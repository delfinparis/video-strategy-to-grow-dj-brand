# CapCut Editing Playbook: Quick Cuts & Zoom for Talking-Head Reels

**Mapped to the AI Agent Minute and Agent Tip of the Day script structures**

---

## The Rule That Governs Everything

Your viewer's thumb is hovering over the screen at all times. Every cut, every zoom, every beat exists for one reason: **to make the next second more interesting than swiping away.** If your edit doesn't serve retention, delete it.

---

## The Two Series Have Different Editing Languages

**AI Agent Minute** is 100% talking head. No B-roll. No guest photos. No split screens. That means cuts and zooms are doing ALL the visual work. Edit aggressively — this series lives or dies on pacing.

**Agent Tip of the Day** has B-roll cues, guest headshots, split screens, and text overlays baked into the production notes. You have more visual variety, so the cuts and zooms are supplemental, not the whole show. Edit with more restraint — let the visuals breathe.

## Part 1: Quick Cuts (Jump Cuts)

### What They Are
A jump cut removes the dead space between thoughts — the breath, the pause, the "um," the blink-and-reset. It makes a 90-second raw take feel like a 55-second conversation where every word earns its place.

### When to Cut

| Cut Here | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Any pause longer than 0.3 seconds | Dead air is a swipe trigger |
| "Um," "uh," "so," "like," filler words | They signal uncertainty — you want authority |
| False starts or repeated phrases | Keep the cleanest take of each thought |
| Between beats in the script (HOOK → INTRO → SETUP, etc.) | Gives each section a fresh burst of energy |
| After every 8–12 seconds of continuous talking | Even perfect delivery needs visual disruption |

### When NOT to Cut

| Let It Breathe | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| A deliberate dramatic pause before a punchline | Silence before impact = power |
| The mirror moment (e.g., "You're carrying the feeling that you're always behind") | Cutting breaks the emotional weight |
| The hook's first 2 seconds | Let the viewer orient — one cut in the first 2 seconds and they're gone |
| During the `[ON-SCREEN]` text moments | The text overlay is already providing visual change — stacking a cut on top feels chaotic |

### How to Do It in CapCut

1. **Import your clip** into a new project (9:16 vertical)
2. **Play through once** without touching anything — just listen for the rhythm
3. **Second pass — split aggressively:**
   - Tap the clip on the timeline
   - Position the playhead at the exact frame where the dead space begins
   - Tap **Split**
   - Move the playhead to where the next clean word starts
   - Tap **Split** again
   - **Delete** the middle chunk
4. **Repeat** through the entire clip. You'll typically make 15–30 cuts on a 60-second reel
5. **Third pass — watch it back.** If any cut feels jarring (audio pops, head jumps too hard), nudge the cut point 2–3 frames in either direction until it feels invisible

### Pro Tip: The Audio-First Method
Don't watch the video while making cuts. **Close your eyes and just listen.** Cut based on the audio rhythm. The visual will follow. This is faster and produces cleaner results because your ear catches dead space your eye misses.

---

## Part 2: The Zoom Punch-In

### What It Is
A subtle zoom-in (typically 10–20% scale increase) on the same clip to simulate a second camera angle. It breaks visual monotony on a single-camera talking head without any extra equipment.

### Why It Works
The human brain treats any visual change as new information. A zoom triggers the viewer to re-engage — "something changed, I should pay attention." This is especially critical for **AI Agent Minute** where you have no B-roll at all.

### The Scale Rules

| Zoom Level | Feels Like | Use For |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 105–110% | Almost invisible, just a nudge | Subtle re-engagement every 8–10 sec |
| 110–120% | Noticeable second angle | Key insights, reframes, punchlines |
| 120–130% | Intense close-up | CTA, one-liner moments, emotional beats |
| 130%+ | Too much — face distorts, looks amateur | Never |

### How to Do It in CapCut

**Method 1: Keyframe Zoom (Smooth Animated Zoom)**
1. **Split** the clip at the point where you want the zoom to begin
2. Tap the **second clip** (the one you want zoomed in)
3. Tap **Keyframe** (diamond icon) at the very start of that clip to set a keyframe
4. Move playhead **5–8 frames forward** (~0.2 seconds)
5. **Pinch to zoom** on the preview to **110–120%**
6. A second keyframe is auto-created
7. At the point where you want to zoom back out, **split again** and reset the scale

**Method 2: Static Zoom (Instant Cut to Closer Framing)**
1. **Split** the clip where you want the zoom
2. Tap the second clip
3. **Pinch to zoom** to 115% in the preview (no keyframes — it just pops in)
4. Make sure your face stays **centered and in the upper third** after zooming

**Method 2 is faster and what most top reel editors use.** Method 1 is for when you want a specific moment to feel cinematic or dramatic.

## Part 3: Beat-by-Beat Edit Maps

### AI Agent Minute — Edit Map

Your scripts follow this flow: **HOOK → BRAND INTRO → PROBLEM → MIRROR MOMENT → AI FIX → REFRAME → CTA → CLOSE**

All talking head. Cuts and zooms do everything.

```
HOOK (first 1–2 sentences)
├── Framing: WIDE
├── Cuts: ZERO in the first 2 seconds. Let it land.
├── Zoom: None — wide establishes authority and confidence
├── [ON-SCREEN] text appears here — that's your visual change
│
│   Example: "Those five words have cost you more commission
│   than any market downturn ever will."
│   → No cut. No zoom. Just the line + text overlay.

BRAND INTRO
├── Framing: Stay WIDE
├── Cuts: One clean cut INTO the intro line
├── Zoom: None — this should feel like a reset, not a moment
├── Cut IMMEDIATELY after "...AI Agent Minute." into the next beat
│
│   "This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast
│   and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
│   → Hard cut after this. New energy starts.

PROBLEM / SETUP (~15–20 sec)
├── Framing: Start WIDE, zoom to MEDIUM (110%) halfway through
├── Cuts: 2–4 jump cuts — this section builds tension, remove all dead air
├── Zoom IN on the pain point sentence
│
│   Example: "You go from showing houses to making dinner
│   with thirty open loops running in your head."
│   → Zoom to 110% on "thirty open loops"

MIRROR MOMENT (the re-hook line)
├── Framing: ZOOM to 115–120%
├── Cuts: NONE — this is a single clean take, let conviction land
├── [ON-SCREEN] text reinforces — that's enough visual change
│
│   Example: "You're not just carrying work home.
│   You're carrying the feeling that you're always behind."
│   → Tight. No cuts. Let it breathe.
│
│   ⚠️ THIS IS YOUR 15-SECOND RE-HOOK.
│   40% of viewers drop around second 12–15.
│   The zoom + the mirror line is what keeps them.

AI FIX (~15–20 sec)
├── Framing: Zoom BACK OUT to WIDE — signals fresh section
├── Cuts: 3–5 jump cuts — this is the densest, most instructional part
├── Zoom IN again on the specific prompt or action step
├── [ON-SCREEN] shows the prompt text — major visual anchor
│
│   Example: "Sort my open items by priority, tell me what
│   can wait or be delegated, and write my top three tasks."
│   → Zoom to 115% when showing the prompt on screen

REFRAME (~10 sec)
├── Framing: MEDIUM zoom (110–115%) — intimate but not intense
├── Cuts: 1–2 max. This is emotional, not informational.
├── Let the strongest line play uncut
│
│   Example: "Objection handling is a muscle. The agents who
│   don't freeze are the ones who practiced until it felt automatic."
│   → One take. Maybe one cut after "muscle." if there's a pause.

CTA (~8 sec)
├── Framing: ZOOM to 120% — tight, direct, personal
├── Cuts: NONE. One clean take, eyes to camera.
├── [ON-SCREEN] shows the question
│
│   Example: "What's the objection you dread most?
│   Drop it below."
│   → Tight zoom, direct delivery, no edit.

CLOSE
├── Framing: Zoom BACK to WIDE
├── "See you next time." — clean, quick, cut to black or end card
```

**Total for a ~60-sec AI Agent Minute: ~18–25 cuts, 4–5 zoom changes.**

### Agent Tip of the Day — Edit Map

Your scripts follow this flow: **HOOK (0:00–0:03) → SETUP (0:03–0:12) → INSIGHT (0:12–0:38) → REFRAME (0:38–0:50) → CTA (0:50–0:60)**

These have B-roll cues, guest headshots, split screens, and production notes built in. You have more visual tools, so use cuts and zooms more sparingly.

```
HOOK (0:00–0:03)
├── Framing: WIDE or dramatic angle per production note
├── Cuts: ZERO. 3 seconds, one line, let it hit.
├── Zoom: None
├── B-roll may open here (e.g., trunk popping open for duvet script)
│
│   Example: "A white duvet in your trunk could be worth
│   thirty thousand dollars."
│   → If opening on B-roll, hard cut to DJ on "thirty thousand."
│   → If opening on DJ, no cut — just the line.

SETUP (0:03–0:12)
├── Framing: WIDE for DJ talking, cut to guest headshot
├── Cuts: 1–2 cuts — one to the guest photo, one back to DJ
├── Zoom: None on DJ — the visual switch to guest IS your engagement beat
├── Guest headshot + name/title overlay does the work here
│
│   Example: "Amanda Pendleton analyzes millions of listings
│   at Zillow. And she found something wild."
│   → Cut to Amanda headshot on "Amanda Pendleton"
│   → Cut back to DJ on "something wild"

INSIGHT (0:12–0:38)
├── This is the longest section — 26 seconds. MOST VULNERABLE TO DROP-OFF.
├── Framing: Start WIDE, zoom to MEDIUM (110%) around 0:20
├── Cuts: 4–6 jump cuts on DJ's talking head portions
├── B-roll cuts per production notes (split screens, data overlays, etc.)
├── The B-roll provides visual variety, so DJ talking sections need fewer zooms
├── ZOOM IN on the guest's key quote or strongest data point
│
│   Example: "'I would probably keep a white duvet in my trunk.'"
│   → Zoom to 115% when delivering the guest quote
│   → This is their moment — the zoom honors it
│
│   ⚠️ RE-HOOK AT 0:15. If you have a strong line near second 15,
│   pair it with either a zoom change or a B-roll cut.
│   Don't let 0:12–0:18 be flat talking head with no visual change.

REFRAME (0:38–0:50)
├── Framing: MEDIUM zoom (110–115%) — back to DJ, intimate
├── Cuts: 1–2 max. This is conviction, not information.
├── No B-roll — this should be DJ direct to camera, undistracted
├── Zoom IN slightly on the "here's the truth" sentence
│
│   Example: "This is the same thing — except nobody's doing
│   it yet. Which means you get the advantage right now."
│   → 115% zoom, clean take, eye contact.

CTA (0:50–0:60)
├── Framing: ZOOM to 120% — tight, direct
├── Cuts: NONE. Homework delivered in one clean take.
├── Text overlay animates in with the action items
├── End card: podcast logo + "Full episode: link in bio"
│
│   Example: "Buy two white duvets this week. Keep them in
│   your car. Use them on your next three listings."
│   → Tight zoom, direct delivery, text overlay with steps.
```

**Total for a ~60-sec Agent Tip: ~10–15 cuts, 3–4 zoom changes.** (Fewer than AI Agent Minute because B-roll does more of the visual work.)

## Part 4: The Key Difference Between the Two Series

| | AI Agent Minute | Agent Tip of the Day |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual variety** | Zero — all talking head | High — B-roll, headshots, split screens |
| **Cut density** | High (18–25 cuts) | Moderate (10–15 cuts) |
| **Zoom changes** | 4–5 per reel | 3–4 per reel |
| **What does the heavy lifting** | Cuts + zooms + on-screen text | B-roll + guest headshots + text overlays |
| **Editing energy** | Fast, punchy, relentless | More cinematic, more breathing room |
| **Where viewers drop** | 0:12–0:15 (mirror moment saves them) | 0:15–0:20 (middle of INSIGHT — need a B-roll cut or zoom here) |

---

## Part 5: CapCut Workflow — Start to Finish

1. **Import** raw vertical clip
2. **Auto captions** — tap Text → Auto Captions → select style (bold, centered, 2–3 words at a time)
3. **Audio-first cut pass** — eyes closed, split and delete all dead space
4. **Zoom pass** — go through the cut clip and add zooms per the beat map above
5. **B-roll pass** (Agent Tips only) — drop in guest headshots, split screens, and B-roll per production notes
6. **Text overlay pass** — add all `[ON-SCREEN]` markers as text elements
7. **Caption cleanup** — fix auto-caption errors, ensure timing syncs with cuts
8. **Full watch at 1x** — phone in hand, full screen, sound on. If your thumb would swipe at any point, fix that spot.
9. **Export** at 1080x1920, 30fps

### CapCut Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Resolution | 1080 x 1920 (9:16) |
| Frame rate | 30fps |
| Caption font | Bold sans-serif (Montserrat Bold or similar) |
| Caption position | Center-bottom, above platform UI safe zone |
| Caption size | Readable on a phone at arm's length |
| Caption style | 2–3 words highlighted at a time, not full sentences |

## Part 6: The Mistakes That Kill Reels

| Mistake | Why It Kills | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| No cuts in the first 10 seconds | Viewer assumes it's a lecture, swipes | At least 2 cuts in the first 10 sec (AI series) or 1 B-roll cut (Tips series) |
| Zooming too far in | Face distortion looks amateur | Never exceed 125% on a phone-shot clip |
| Cutting on audio mid-word | Creates jarring audio pops | Always cut between words, in the silence gap |
| Same zoom level the whole video | Brain habituates, stops re-engaging | Alternate wide → medium → tight per the beat map |
| Captions covering your face | Viewer can't connect with you | Keep captions in the bottom third |
| Adding music louder than voice | This isn't a montage — it's a message | Music at 10–15% volume max, or skip entirely |
| Over-editing the mirror moment or reframe | Cuts destroy emotional weight | If a line is powerful, let it breathe — no cut, no zoom |
| Cutting during `[ON-SCREEN]` text | Visual overload — text + cut + zoom = chaos | Text overlay IS the visual change. Hold the shot. |
| Flat section at 0:12–0:18 | This is the biggest drop-off zone | Must have a zoom change, B-roll cut, or mirror moment here |

---

## The One-Sentence Summary

**Cut the silence, zoom the insight, and never let 3 seconds pass without giving the viewer's brain a reason to stay.**
