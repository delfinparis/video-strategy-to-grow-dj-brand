## AI Agent Minute Category-to-Pillar Mapping

The AI scripts use 9 granular categories. Here's how they map to the 5 pillars:

| AI Script Category | Content Pillar |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Lead Generation | Top Producer Secrets + The AI Agent |
| Conversion & Sales | Top Producer Secrets + The AI Agent |
| Time & Productivity | Systems That Scale + The AI Agent |
| Systems & Operations | Systems That Scale + The AI Agent |
| Mindset & Motivation | Real Talk + The AI Agent |
| Money & Business | Top Producer Secrets + The AI Agent |
| Market & Industry | Market Intelligence + The AI Agent |
| Personal Brand | Top Producer Secrets + The AI Agent |
| Client Management | Top Producer Secrets + The AI Agent |

Note: Every AI Agent Minute script maps to "The AI Agent" pillar by default (since AI is always the delivery mechanism), plus one additional pillar based on the topic.
