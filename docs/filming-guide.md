## Filming Sessions

### Batch Structure
- **Session length:** ~4 hours per 10-script batch
- **Film on:** Sundays (gives Monday to review footage)
- **Buffer rule:** Maintain 2-week minimum between filming and posting date
- **Energy tip:** Film the highest-scored script first when energy is highest

### Prep Before Each Session
1. Run through each script once before recording
2. Confirm camera and lights are hot before starting
3. Have water nearby
4. Film each script in one take minimum -- imperfection is authenticity
5. For AI Agent Minute: have the Claude/ChatGPT screen ready if doing demo shots

| Session | Film Date | Scripts | Posts Start | Posts End |

## Post-Production

### Captions
- **Required on all videos** -- 80% of viewers watch on mute
- Use auto-caption tools or manual captions
- Highlight key phrases with colored/bold text overlays

### On-Screen Text Overlays
Each script specifies `[ON-SCREEN: "..."]` markers. Add these as text overlays at the indicated moments.

### Branding
- Consistent intro frame or lower-third with "Keeping It Real Podcast" and "Kale Realty"
- End card with podcast logo + "Full episode: link in bio" (for Agent Tips)

## Platform Posting Strategy

### Instagram Reels
- 60-second max (aim for 45-60)
- Vertical format (9:16)
- Captions required
- Post 1-2x daily
- Best times: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 7-9pm

### TikTok
- 60 seconds is the sweet spot
- More casual, less polished OK
- Trending sounds can boost reach
- Post 2-3x daily for growth phase
- Engage in comments heavily

### YouTube Shorts
- 60-second max
- Vertical format
- Evergreen discovery potential
- Post 1-2x daily
- Link to full episodes in description

### LinkedIn
- Professional tone
- 60-90 seconds
- Text post + video performs well
- Post 1x daily
- Best for B2B recruiting

## Comment-to-DM Strategy

Many AI Agent Minute scripts use CTAs like "Comment FOLLOW-UP below and I'll send you the exact prompt."

**Before filming these scripts:**
- Set up ManyChat (or similar) for automated comment-to-DM delivery
- OR plan to manually reply to comments with the promised resource
- This must be configured before filming -- don't promise something you can't deliver

---

## CTA Types Used Across Scripts

| CTA Type | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Comment keyword | When offering a resource | "Comment FOLLOW-UP for the prompt" |
| Drop your answer | When asking a question | "Drop your biggest cold call fear below" |
| Be honest | When inviting vulnerability | "When's the last time you audited your ROI? Be honest." |
| Tell me | When requesting stories | "What's your open house follow-up process?" |
| Save this | When the content is reference-worthy | "Save this and try it tonight" |
