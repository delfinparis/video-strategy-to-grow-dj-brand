The best real estate deals never hit the MLS. They're sitting in public county records that 99% of agents never bother to check - pre-foreclosure properties with homeowners who often don't even know their options exist.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down how to use AI tools like Claude to build a compassionate outreach system that actually helps families in crisis. This isn't about being predatory - it's about reaching homeowners before the bank does something irreversible, offering genuine solutions like short sales, cash buyer connections, and flexible timelines.

Most agents avoid this goldmine because they don't know how to approach it correctly. The key? Leading with empathy and real options, not a sales pitch.

Do you work pre-foreclosure leads, or have you been avoiding this market? What's been your biggest challenge with distressed property outreach?

Here's what most real estate professionals don't realize: the best investment opportunities are documented in public county records, not hidden behind exclusive networks or premium platforms.

Pre-foreclosure properties represent families in genuine distress who often lack basic information about their options. Many don't know short sales exist, that they might preserve their credit by selling quickly, or that cash buyers could close on flexible timelines.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how AI tools like Claude can help agents build systematic, empathetic outreach that serves both business growth and community impact. The approach focuses on leading with genuine help and education rather than opportunistic pitches.

This market segment remains largely untapped because most agents either don't know how to access the data or approach these sensitive situations professionally. Yet done correctly, it represents one of the most meaningful ways to provide value during someone's most challenging financial moment.

How do you balance business development with genuine community service in your real estate practice?
