Divorce is the second most common reason couples sell their home — yet most real estate agents have never contacted a single divorce attorney to introduce themselves. Think about that opportunity for a second.

Family law attorneys desperately need agents who can handle emotionally charged transactions, provide accurate valuations under pressure, and close deals when neither seller wants to cooperate. Most agents avoid this complexity, which means the relationship is usually wide open.

Here's what D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast discovered: One strong relationship with the right divorce attorney can generate 5-10 deals per year, consistently, regardless of market conditions. The secret? Most agents never even try to build these referral relationships.

The fix involves using AI to create a professional outreach package that positions you as the go-to agent for high-stakes divorce transactions. It's a completely untapped lead source hiding in plain sight.

Here's a lead generation strategy most real estate professionals completely overlook: building referral relationships with family law attorneys.

The data is striking — divorce ranks as the second most common reason couples sell their home. Yet in my experience speaking with hundreds of agents, most have never introduced themselves to a single divorce attorney in their market.

These attorneys face a real challenge. They need agents who can navigate emotionally charged transactions, handle competing client interests, meet court-ordered timelines, and provide accurate asset valuations under pressure. It requires patience, emotional intelligence, and technical competence that most agents simply don't specialize in.

Here's the opportunity: that referral relationship is usually available because most agents never attempt to build it. One strong partnership with the right attorney can generate 5-10 transactions annually, providing consistent business regardless of market fluctuations.

The solution involves positioning yourself proactively — creating a professional outreach package that demonstrates your competence in handling complex, high-stakes transactions before you ever meet your first divorce client.

What's been your experience with divorce-related transactions? Have you found them more challenging or rewarding than traditional sales?
