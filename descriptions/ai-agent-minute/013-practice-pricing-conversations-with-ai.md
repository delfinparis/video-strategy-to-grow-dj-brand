Most agents overprice listings because they're terrified of one conversation - and it costs everyone months they'll never get back. The house sits, the seller gets frustrated, and the listing expires. Then they do it all over again at the next appointment.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast just dropped a game-changing solution: practice pricing conversations with AI before you need them. Tell Claude to act like an emotional seller who thinks their home is worth $50k more than comps support, then practice walking them toward reality without losing the listing.

Run this roleplay weekly for just 10 minutes. By the time you're in the real conversation, the words flow naturally. Because telling sellers the truth about price is the most valuable thing you can do for them - you just need the courage to do it.

Have you ever taken an overpriced listing just to keep the relationship? (No judgment here - we've all been there!)

Agents overprice listings because they're afraid to tell sellers the truth - then everyone loses months they can't get back 📈

The costly cycle: Agent overprices → house sits 90 days → seller blames agent → listing expires → repeat. D.J. Paris just shared how to break it.

Practice with AI first. Tell Claude: "Act as a seller who believes their home is worth $50k more than comps support." Run this weekly before appointments.

The most expensive conversation in real estate isn't about commission - it's about price. And most agents avoid it at all costs.

Here's the cycle that destroys relationships and wastes time: Agent fears losing listing → overprices property → house sits 90 days → seller blames agent → listing expires. Then it repeats at the next appointment because the agent still hasn't developed the skills to handle pricing objections.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast offers a solution that's both simple and brilliant: practice these difficult conversations with AI before you're in the room with emotional sellers.

The approach is straightforward. Ask Claude to roleplay as a seller who believes their home is worth significantly more than comparable sales support. Practice navigating their pushback, building your confidence and refining your language in a safe environment.

What transforms agents isn't avoiding difficult conversations - it's preparing for them. How do you currently prepare for challenging pricing discussions with clients?
