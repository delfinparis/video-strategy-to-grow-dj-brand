By March, 67% of people have already forgotten the goals they set in January. Sound familiar?

Here's the brutal truth: "I want to close 50 deals this year" isn't a goal—it's a wish. And wishes don't pay the mortgage. The agents who actually hit their numbers? They reverse-engineer the math. They know exactly how many calls today equal closed deals in 90 days.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down how to use AI to turn your annual goal into daily actions that actually move the needle. No more hoping the market cooperates. No more expensive disappointments.

What's your deal goal for this year? Let's turn it into a daily action plan.

Most real estate professionals abandon their annual goals by March. Not because they lack ambition, but because they mistake wishes for actionable plans.

"I want to close 50 deals this year" sounds like a goal. But without daily activities attached, it's just expensive hope. The top producers understand something fundamental: every closed transaction is the result of a predictable sequence of daily actions.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how AI can reverse-engineer your income target into specific daily metrics. Instead of hoping for market cooperation, you're building a mathematical pathway to your goal.

The difference between successful agents and struggling ones isn't talent or market conditions—it's turning annual aspirations into daily accountabilities.

What daily actions are you tracking to ensure you hit your 2024 production goals?
