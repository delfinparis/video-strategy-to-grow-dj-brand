You're competing against agents you've never even looked up. In a market this competitive, that's a recipe for losing deals on instinct instead of intelligence.

You're competing against agents you've never even looked up. In today's hyper-competitive real estate market, that approach is costing you deals.

Most agents have only a vague sense of their real competition. They know the obvious names but have never studied their online presence, production numbers, messaging, or client reviews. The result? They compete on instinct and consistently lose the same types of listings.

The agents who dominate their markets take a different approach. They know exactly who they're up against and, more importantly, where those agents are vulnerable.

D.J. Paris shares a 30-minute AI-powered research process that reveals competitive gaps. Use Perplexity to gather intel on your top competitors' recent production, social positioning, and reviews. Then leverage Claude to identify three underserved angles you could own in your market.

This intelligence often reveals untapped opportunities in specific price ranges, neighborhoods, or client demographics that become your competitive advantage.

How do you currently research your competition? Are you making strategic moves or competing on instinct?
