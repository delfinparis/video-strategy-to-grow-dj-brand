Here's an uncomfortable truth: Most real estate professionals spend marketing dollars the same way people purchase gym memberships — with optimism, but without any system to track whether it's delivering results.

I see agents every day throwing thousands at lead sources, direct mail campaigns, and digital ads because they "feel like" it's working, or because a colleague recommended it. Meanwhile, they have zero data on actual ROI.

The difference between average producers and top performers isn't just budget size — it's evidence-based decision making. Top producers don't spend on instinct; they spend on data.

In this episode, D.J. Paris shares a simple AI-powered system for quarterly budget allocation and ROI tracking that can save you thousands in wasted marketing spend. The tracking framework takes minutes to implement but fundamentally changes how you invest in business growth.

What percentage of your current marketing investments do you actively track for measurable ROI?
