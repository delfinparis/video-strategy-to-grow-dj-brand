Your past clients are getting their market information from Zillow headlines and cable news segments — content that's often alarmist and completely irrelevant to what's happening in YOUR neighborhood. They're forming opinions about the market without you.

Here's the reality: The agent who becomes the most trusted source of local market information gets the most calls when it's time to buy or sell. D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down how to become that agent in just 20 minutes a month using AI.

Pull your MLS data, feed it to Claude, and ask for a conversational (not statistical) market update. Send it to your entire database every month without fail.

Your sphere of influence is consuming market information right now. The question is: are they getting it from you, or from sensationalized news headlines?

D.J. Paris, VP of Business Development at Kale Realty and host of 700+ real estate podcast episodes, shares a sobering truth: "If your clients are getting their market information from the news instead of from you — you've already lost your position as their trusted advisor."

The solution isn't complicated, but it requires consistency. Using AI tools like Claude, agents can transform raw MLS data into conversational, actionable market insights in under 20 minutes per month. The key is making it conversational, not statistical, and ending with one specific actionable insight.

The agent who becomes the most trusted source of local market information inevitably gets the most calls when it's time to buy or sell. It's about positioning yourself as the expert before your clients need you.

What's your current strategy for keeping your database informed about market conditions in your area?
