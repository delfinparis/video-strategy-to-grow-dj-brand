Real estate investors are among the most loyal, repeat clients in our industry — but 90% of agents lose them in the first conversation. Why? They're speaking two completely different languages.

When an investor asks about a property, they want cap rates, cash-on-cash returns, and five-year appreciation trends. Most agents respond with granite countertops and school districts. It's like showing up to a business meeting speaking the wrong language entirely.

Here's what D.J. Paris discovered: AI tools like Perplexity and Claude can help you build investor-specific consultation frameworks that actually speak their language. The result? Investors who trust you buy multiple properties AND refer their network.

The math is simple: one satisfied investor client can transform your entire business. They're not just buying one home — they're building portfolios.

What percentage of your current business comes from real estate investors?

Most real estate professionals miss one of the highest-value client segments in our industry: investors. And it's not because investors are hard to find — it's because we're having the wrong conversation from day one.

Here's what typically happens: An investor inquires about a rental property. They're thinking cap rates, cash-on-cash returns, rent-to-price ratios. The agent responds with information about finishes, school districts, and neighborhood charm. Two people, two completely different languages.

D.J. Paris from Kale Realty identified something crucial in this dynamic: investors represent some of the most loyal, repeat clients in real estate. They don't just buy once — they build portfolios. And they refer within their networks.

The solution he presents is elegant: use AI tools like Perplexity to gather rental market data and Claude to build investor-specific consultation frameworks. It's about showing up prepared to discuss ROI, risk assessment, and exit strategies instead of granite countertops.

The business impact is significant. One investor who trusts your analysis doesn't just become a client — they become a long-term relationship that drives portfolio growth and network referrals.

What percentage of your real estate business currently comes from investment clients, and how do you tailor your approach to speak their language?
