Most real estate agents live in the same brutal cycle their entire career: January broke, June great, September stressed. Sound familiar?

Here's the painful truth - you're creating this feast-or-famine cycle yourself. When business is slow, you prospect like crazy. When it picks up, you stop prospecting because you're "too busy." That busy season you think is success? It's actually creating your next slow season.

In this AI Agent Minute, D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shows you exactly how to use Claude AI to build a "pipeline floor" - the minimum prospecting activity that guarantees consistent closings every month. No more panic, no more cycles.

The busy season is exactly when you must protect your prospecting time. That's the only thing that ends the cycle.

Are you currently in a feast or famine season with your business?

D.J. Paris breaks down how to use Claude AI to build your "pipeline floor" - the minimum activity that guarantees consistent income every month.

The feast-or-famine income cycle isn't bad luck - it's a pipeline problem most agents unknowingly create themselves.

Here's the pattern: slow season hits, you prospect aggressively. Business picks up, you get "too busy" to prospect. That busy period feels like success, but it's actually setting up your next drought. The cycle repeats for entire careers.

In this latest episode insight from D.J. Paris at Kale Realty, he demonstrates how AI can help break this cycle by establishing a "pipeline floor" - the minimum prospecting activity needed to maintain consistent monthly closings, regardless of how busy you get.

The key insight? The busy season is exactly when protecting your prospecting time matters most. That's the only way to end the cycle permanently.

What's your experience with income consistency in real estate? Are you currently managing a feast or famine period?
