Most agents think niching down means turning away business. The truth? When you try to serve everyone, you're memorable to no one. Top producers don't attract everyone — they attract exactly the right people, who then send everyone they know.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down why "I work with all buyers and sellers" is the most forgettable sentence in real estate marketing. Plus, he shares a brilliant AI prompt to help you discover your perfect niche using Claude.

Here's the game-changer: A niche doesn't shrink your market — it sharpens your message so the right people find you faster. When you become the obvious choice for a specific group, you actually generate MORE business, not less.

If you had to specialize in just one type of client (first-time buyers, luxury sellers, relocating families, etc.) — who would it be and why?

"I work with all buyers and sellers in the greater metro area."

If this sounds like your elevator pitch, you've just identified why your marketing isn't working. When you try to serve everyone, you become memorable to no one.

The counterintuitive truth? Top producers don't attract everyone — they attract exactly the right people. And those people become referral machines, sending everyone they know. Specialization doesn't limit your business; it amplifies it by making you the obvious choice for a specific group.

The fear of niching down is real. Agents worry they'll turn away business. But here's what actually happens: when you sharpen your message, the right people find you faster. Your expertise becomes undeniable. Your referrals become targeted and qualified.

D.J. Paris shares a powerful AI discovery process using Claude to identify your perfect niche based on your natural strengths, preferred clients, and unique story. The goal isn't to exclude — it's to excel.

If you had to choose one specialty that leverages your unique background and expertise, what would it be?
