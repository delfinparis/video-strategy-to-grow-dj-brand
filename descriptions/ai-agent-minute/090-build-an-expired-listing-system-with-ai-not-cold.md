Expired listings convert at dramatically higher rates when you're thoughtful instead of confident. The data is clear on this.

Most agents call expired sellers and say "I can sell your home" — exactly what the last three failed agents said. These sellers aren't just skeptical, they're done with generic pitches and headshot postcards.

Here's what top producers do differently: They study the listing first. Days on market, price reductions, neighborhood signals. Then they use AI to craft outreach that acknowledges frustration and identifies specific reasons why it didn't sell. No confidence. Just curiosity.

D.J. Paris breaks down the exact Claude prompts that turn expired leads into listings. Because expired sellers don't need another certain agent — they need one curious enough to ask what went wrong.

What's your current approach to expired listings?

Expired sellers don't need another confident agent. They need a thoughtful one — and AI helps you show up that way every time. 🎯

D.J. Paris shows you the exact Claude prompts to craft personalized outreach that converts at dramatically higher rates. The key? Sound curious, not certain.

The highest-intent leads in real estate? Expired listings. These sellers already decided to sell — they just need to try with someone better.

Yet most agents approach them exactly like the previous agents who failed: "I can sell your home" calls and generic postcards. After multiple disappointments, these sellers are done with confidence without substance.

Here's what separates top producers: they study expired listings before contacting them. List price, days on market, reduction patterns, neighborhood dynamics. Then they use AI to craft outreach that's specific to that situation — acknowledging frustration and identifying concrete reasons why it didn't sell.

As D.J. Paris explains in this AI Agent Minute, the prompt that works asks Claude to "sound thoughtful, not confident" and always opens with questions, not pitches. The conversion data on personalized expired outreach vs. generic approaches is striking.

What's been your most effective strategy for converting expired listings into new business?
