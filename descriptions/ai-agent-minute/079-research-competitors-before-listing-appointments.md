Most real estate agents walk into listing appointments like they're playing poker without looking at their own cards. They have no idea who else is being interviewed, what those competitors bring to the table, or how to differentiate themselves.

Here's what the top producers know that everyone else ignores: sellers typically interview 2-3 agents, and the ones who win consistently show up with strategy, not just a folder and hope. They've researched their competition's recent neighborhood sales, online presence, reviews, and average days on market before they ever knock on that door.

Here's an uncomfortable truth: most real estate professionals treat listing appointments like a casual coffee meeting instead of the competitive business pitch they actually are.

Sellers typically interview 2-3 agents, yet the majority of agents walk in completely blind to who they're competing against. They bring a folder, some comps, and hope for the best. Meanwhile, top producers are doing their homework.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates a strategic approach using AI tools to research competitors' recent neighborhood production, online positioning, client reviews, and market performance. The key insight? Use this intelligence to differentiate your presentation without ever mentioning competitors by name.

This isn't about playing dirty—it's about being prepared. In a competitive market, preparation separates professionals from participants. When you understand how your competition positions themselves, you can strategically highlight your unique value propositions.

What's your pre-appointment research process? Do you go in prepared or wing it?
