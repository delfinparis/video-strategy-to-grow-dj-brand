The gap between a house that sells in 5 days versus 90 days? It's almost always preparation. Most sellers are flying blind, spending money on the wrong improvements while missing what today's buyers actually care about.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast just dropped a game-changer: using AI to create a comprehensive "Seller Prep Playbook" that eliminates the guesswork. Instead of giving sellers a generic to-do list, top agents are now providing detailed roadmaps with the highest-ROI improvements, room-by-room decluttering guides, and market-specific buyer preferences.

The secret sauce? Ask Claude for a playbook that includes the 10 highest-ROI improvements, decluttering checklists, current buyer priorities, and the 3 most common seller mistakes that quietly tank sale prices. Turn it into a PDF and watch your listing appointments transform.

A prepared home sells faster and for more money. A prepared seller trusts you more.

What's the ONE thing sellers do before listing that makes you cringe every time?

Here's what separates homes that sell in 5 days from those that languish for 90: preparation. Yet most real estate professionals are still handing sellers generic checklists and hoping for the best.

The challenge isn't just that sellers are emotionally attached to their homes—it's that they genuinely don't know what today's buyers prioritize. They'll spend thousands on improvements that don't move the needle while ignoring the details that actually drive offers.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares a strategic approach that's changing how top producers handle pre-listing preparation. Instead of general advice, they're using AI tools like Claude to create comprehensive "Seller Prep Playbooks" tailored to their specific markets and price points.

The framework is brilliant in its simplicity: request the 10 highest-ROI improvements, room-by-room decluttering protocols, current market buyer preferences, and the three most costly seller mistakes. Package it professionally, present it at listing appointments, and watch your credibility—and results—transform.

A prepared home doesn't just sell faster; it positions you as the strategic advisor rather than just another agent with opinions.

What's the most counterproductive thing you see sellers do during the prep phase?
