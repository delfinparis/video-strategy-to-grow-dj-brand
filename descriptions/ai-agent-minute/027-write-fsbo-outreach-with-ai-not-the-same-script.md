Every FSBO seller in your market is getting bombarded with the same pushy "you need an agent" calls this week. But here's what most agents get wrong: they're trying to prove value before building trust.

The FSBO's biggest fear isn't commission costs—it's whether they can actually handle the sale themselves. The agent who genuinely helps them try (not sabotages their efforts) is the one who gets the listing when they realize they're in over their head.

DJ Paris breaks down why the "help first, ask later" approach converts FSBOs when traditional pitches fail. It's about earning each conversation instead of forcing your way in.

Have you ever successfully converted a FSBO listing? What approach worked for you?

Most agents pitch FSBOs. Top producers help them first and earn the listing later. 🎯

The FSBO who eventually lists with an agent almost always lists with the one who helped them most before asking for anything. DJ Paris reveals the "consultation-first" model that actually converts.

Stop being the fourth version of the same pushy call. Start being the agent who genuinely adds value first.

Every FSBO seller gets hammered with the same commission objection calls. Most agents lead with why the seller needs them before the seller has decided they trust them.

But here's the insight most agents miss: The FSBO's primary concern isn't commission costs—it's whether they can successfully manage the transaction themselves. The agent who genuinely helps them attempt the sale (rather than sabotaging their efforts) earns the listing when they inevitably need professional assistance.

DJ Paris introduces the "consultation-first" model: three touches where you provide genuine value before ever asking for the listing. Touch one offers something immediately useful—market analysis, staging checklist, or document guidance. No pitch. No pressure. Just value.

The data is clear: FSBOs who eventually list with an agent choose the one who helped them most before asking for anything in return. It's about earning each conversation instead of demanding it.

What's been your experience with FSBO outreach? Have you found success with the relationship-first approach?
