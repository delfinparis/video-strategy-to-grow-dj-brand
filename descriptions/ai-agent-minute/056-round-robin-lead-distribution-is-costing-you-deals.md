Most real estate teams lose deals before they even start - not because of bad leads, but because they're giving the right leads to the wrong agents. When your brand-new agent gets handed a $2M luxury relocation and inevitably loses it, that client doesn't just walk away quietly. They tell everyone they know about their terrible experience with your brokerage.

Round-robin lead distribution feels fair, but it's actually costing you deals AND destroying agent confidence. The rookie who keeps getting leads they can't handle starts doubting themselves. The seasoned pro who gets stuck with mismatched clients gets frustrated and performs below their potential.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to fix this with a simple AI-powered lead routing system that matches the right agent to the right client every single time. No more random results from random distribution.

Does your team have a formal lead routing process, or are you still doing first-come-first-served?

Random lead distribution = random results (and lost deals you'll never get back) 🎯

Most teams hand leads to whoever answers the phone first. But when your new agent gets a luxury buyer and your luxury specialist gets a first-time buyer who needs hand-holding, BOTH deals are probably toast.

D.J. Paris shows you exactly how to build an AI lead routing system that matches client types to agent strengths every time. No more lost confidence, no more lost commissions.

Tell me honestly - does your team route leads strategically or just wing it? Drop it below 👇

The wrong agent getting the right lead isn't just an efficiency problem - it's a reputation killer that compounds with every lost deal.

I see this constantly: teams distribute leads by round-robin or whoever picks up the phone first, thinking it's "fair." But fairness to agents doesn't equal success for clients. When a brand-new agent gets handed a complex luxury relocation, that client walks away disappointed and tells their network about the poor experience.

The hidden cost? It's not just the lost commission. It's the agent's shattered confidence and the deals you'll never even get a chance at because of damaged reputation.

D.J. Paris demonstrates how top teams are using AI to build smart lead routing matrices that consider lead complexity, agent strengths, current workload, and specializations. The result? Better outcomes for clients, more confidence for agents, and higher conversion rates across the board.

What's your team's current lead distribution process - strategic matching or first-come-first-served?
