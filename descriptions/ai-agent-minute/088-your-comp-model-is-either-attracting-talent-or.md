Most team leaders build their compensation models by copying what another team is doing — adjusting slightly and calling it a day. No math. No analysis of actual costs. Just copying someone else's homework without knowing if it even works.

The result? Either a model so thin it repels top talent, or so generous it's unsustainable when leads dry up. And here's the brutal truth: wrong compensation models breed resentment in both directions. Too little and agents leave. Too much and you resent them.

D.J. Paris breaks down how to use AI to build a compensation model based on YOUR actual numbers — cost per lead, close rates, overhead, training investment. Math first, model second. The best comp plan isn't the most generous one, it's the one that's sustainable for you and motivating for your agents.

Do you actually know your cost per closed deal right now? Be honest.

Here's an uncomfortable truth for real estate team leaders: your compensation model is either attracting the agents you want or quietly driving them to your competition.

The problem? Most comp models are built by looking at what another team does, making slight adjustments, and hoping for the best. No analysis of actual cost per lead. No calculation of training investment per agent. No modeling of sustainable profitability.

The result is predictable — either a model too thin to attract top talent, or one so generous it becomes unsustainable when market conditions shift. Both scenarios breed resentment that destroys team culture.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares how AI can help you build a compensation structure based on your real numbers: cost per lead, close rates, average commission, overhead, and training investment. When you have the math, you can create a model that's both sustainable for the business and motivating for your agents.

The best compensation plan isn't the most generous one — it's the one built on solid financial foundation that rewards performance while protecting profitability.

Do you know your actual cost per closed deal, or are you operating on assumptions?
