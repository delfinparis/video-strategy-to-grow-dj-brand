Random posting is just noise with occasional bursts of effort - and the algorithm can tell the difference. Most agents post when they feel inspired, but top producers post on a plan that actually builds an audience.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to use Claude AI to create a 90-day content calendar in one session. No more staring at a blank screen wondering what to post. No more inconsistent messaging that confuses potential clients.

The simple prompt he shares generates topic, hook, and CTA for every single post - mapped out week by week around your content pillars and business goals. Print it, put it on your wall, execute it.

Content that compounds is content that was planned. Spontaneous posts generate spontaneous results - which is to say, almost none.

Do you currently have a content calendar or are you figuring it out day by day?

Random posting isn't a content strategy - it's noise with occasional bursts of effort. And both your audience and the algorithm can tell the difference.

I've observed that most real estate professionals post when they feel inspired. The top producers? They post according to a strategic plan that builds audiences which actually convert to business.

In this episode of Keeping It Real Podcast's AI Agent Minute, D.J. Paris demonstrates how to leverage Claude AI to construct a comprehensive 90-day content calendar in a single session. One well-crafted prompt generates the topic, hook, and call-to-action for every post, mapped around your content pillars and business objectives.

No more staring at blank screens. No more inconsistent messaging that leaves potential clients confused about what you represent. Content that compounds is content that was planned - spontaneous posts generate spontaneous results.

The execution is simple: print it, display it, execute it systematically.

Are you currently operating with a strategic content calendar, or are you determining your posts day by day?
