Most agents send relocation buyers a Zillow link and call it service. Meanwhile, top producers are using AI to create comprehensive welcome packets that position them as city experts before the first phone call even happens.

Here's the reality: relocation buyers are your most valuable clients, but they need completely different treatment than local buyers. They're moving somewhere unfamiliar and need an agent who can make that city feel less scary. D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to use Claude and Perplexity to build neighborhood profiles, commute data, school comparisons, and buying timelines that actually help these high-value clients.

The money line? "They will call every other agent and send it to that one." When you're the agent providing real value upfront, you're not competing on commission anymore.

What's the first question relocation buyers always ask you when they call?

Here's what most real estate professionals get wrong about relocation buyers: they treat them exactly like local clients.

Relocation buyers represent some of the highest-value opportunities in our industry. They're moving significant distances, often have substantial budgets, and when you serve them well, they become clients for life. Yet most agents send them a property search link and schedule showings without addressing their real need: understanding an unfamiliar market.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how AI tools like Claude and Perplexity can help you build comprehensive relocation welcome packets. We're talking neighborhood profiles, commute analysis, school data, and step-by-step buying processes specifically designed for out-of-town buyers. This isn't just good service—it's strategic positioning.

The insight that stuck with me: "Relocation buyers choose agents who make an unfamiliar city feel familiar." When you provide this level of value upfront, you're not competing on commission anymore. You're the obvious choice.

For those who've worked with relocation clients: what's the most important information they need that local buyers never ask about?
