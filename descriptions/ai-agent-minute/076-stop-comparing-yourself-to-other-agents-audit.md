The agents who scroll social media the most tend to produce the least in their business. That's not a coincidence.

Every real estate agent has done it — looked at another agent's highlight reel and felt terrible about their own behind-the-scenes reality. But here's what that comparison is actually costing you: it's pulling your focus away from building your own business at the exact moment you need it most.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares a game-changing AI hack to break the comparison trap. Instead of scrolling when you feel that spiral coming on, audit your own trajectory using real numbers. The only timeline that actually matters is yours.

What's one metric in your real estate business that's genuinely better than it was a year ago?

Stop measuring your behind-the-scenes against everyone else's highlight reel — it's costing you more than you think 👆

The agents who scroll the most tend to produce the least. When comparison hits, try this AI hack instead:

Open Claude → Share your stats from 12 months ago vs today → Ask it to "write my progress narrative grounded in real numbers" → Read THAT instead of scrolling.

The only timeline that actually matters is yours ✨

Here's an uncomfortable truth about real estate professionals: the agents who scroll social media the most tend to produce the least in their business.

We've all been there — looking at another agent's record-breaking month or luxury listing post and feeling inadequate about our own progress. But this comparison habit isn't just demoralizing; it's actively pulling focus away from building our own businesses when we need that energy most.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast offers a brilliant alternative: use AI to audit your own trajectory instead. When the comparison spiral hits, open Claude, input your actual numbers from 12 months ago versus today, and ask it to write your progress narrative based on real data.

This shifts your attention back to the only timeline that truly matters — your own. Instead of consuming other people's highlight reels, you're celebrating your genuine progress and refocusing on forward momentum.

What's one metric in your business that's measurably better than it was a year ago? I'd love to hear about your real progress.
