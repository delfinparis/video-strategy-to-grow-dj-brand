Culture isn't what you say on your website — it's what you do on a Tuesday when nobody's watching. Most real estate teams think they have great culture, but they've never actually defined it. The result? Whoever's having the worst day sets the tone for everyone.

Here's what most team leaders miss: top agents choose teams based on culture as much as commission splits. They're talking to each other about what it's really like to work with you. Word travels fast in this industry.

D.J. Paris breaks down why you need a written culture document (not just a mission statement) and shares the exact prompt to help you create one with AI in just one afternoon. It becomes your recruiting tool, retention tool, and accountability system all at once.

Does your team have a written culture document, or are you letting culture happen by accident?

Most real estate teams believe they have great culture. They genuinely mean it when they talk about it in recruiting conversations. But here's the uncomfortable truth: if you haven't defined your culture in writing, it doesn't actually exist.

Culture by default becomes whoever's having the worst day. An agent who's struggling sets the emotional tone. Conflicts go unresolved because there's no process. New team members don't know what's expected, and veterans don't know what gets celebrated.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast points out what this really costs us: top agents choose teams based on culture as much as commission structures. They're comparing notes with each other. Your reputation travels faster than your marketing.

The solution isn't another mission statement. It's a working culture document that defines celebrated behaviors, unacceptable actions, conflict resolution processes, and what success actually looks like on your team. When culture is written down, it becomes a recruiting tool, retention strategy, and accountability system all in one.

What's your experience? Does your team operate with a defined culture document, or are you letting culture happen by accident?
