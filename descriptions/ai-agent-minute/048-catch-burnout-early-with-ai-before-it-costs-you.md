By the time you recognize burnout, you're already three months deep into it. Most agents think burnout looks like complete collapse, but that's not how it works in real estate.

The real signs? You're still showing up, still closing deals, but you're getting shorter with clients. You're procrastinating on calls you used to make without thinking. You're dreading Sunday nights in a way you didn't two years ago. The grind continues, but something feels off.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares a game-changing weekly check-in using Claude AI. Five simple questions every Sunday that help you spot patterns before they become problems. Because you can't fix what you refuse to see.

Taking care of yourself isn't soft — it's the most strategic move for the business you built. Scale of 1-10, how energized are you about your business right now?

Burnout in real estate doesn't announce itself with dramatic fanfare. It's subtle, insidious, and by the time most agents recognize it, they're already three months deep.

Here's what it actually looks like: You're still showing up. Still closing deals. But you're getting shorter with clients, procrastinating on calls you used to make instinctively, and dreading Sunday nights in a way that feels foreign. The grind continues, but the engine sounds different.

Most successful agents push through these signals because resilience got them here. But ignoring early warning signs is exactly how careers end quietly — not with a bang, but with a slow fade.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares a strategic approach: weekly mental check-ins using Claude AI. Five simple questions every Sunday that reveal patterns across four weeks. What drained your energy? What energized you? What are you avoiding? The data doesn't lie.

Taking care of yourself isn't soft — it's the most strategic move you can make for the business you've built. You can't lead clients effectively if you're running on fumes.
