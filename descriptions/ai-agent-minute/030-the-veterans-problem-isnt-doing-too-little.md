After ten years in real estate, most veteran agents aren't underperforming — they're literally burning out from doing too much of the wrong things. That Zillow campaign from 2019 that stopped producing? Still running. Those three networking events you attend out of guilt? Still on your calendar. The monthly newsletter that takes four hours and generates zero calls? Still happening.

D.J. Paris breaks down why complexity is killing your productivity and how one simple audit with AI can help you get more done in 30 hours than you used to in 50. The agents who've done this business simplification report cutting their workload by 40% while maintaining the same production levels.

The fix isn't adding more to your plate — it's identifying the 20% that drives 80% of your results and having the courage to cut everything else.

What's one thing in your real estate business that you're still doing purely out of habit rather than conviction?

Most veteran agents aren't underperforming — they're exhausted from doing too much of the wrong things.

After a decade, you've accumulated layers of marketing that stopped working years ago. That Zillow campaign from 2019. Three guilt-based networking events. A newsletter that takes 4 hours and generates zero calls.

D.J. Paris explains how one AI audit helped agents get more done in 30 hours than they used to in 50. The secret? Cut everything except the 20% driving 80% of results.

POV: You've been in real estate for 10 years and you're more exhausted than ever 😮‍💨 The problem isn't doing too little — it's doing too much of what stopped working years ago.

After a decade in real estate, the most successful veteran agents I know have learned one critical lesson: complexity kills productivity.

Here's what accumulates without anyone noticing — marketing campaigns from 2019 that stopped producing, networking events attended out of obligation rather than strategy, tools you're paying for but barely using. None of it gets audited. It just keeps running on autopilot while you get increasingly exhausted.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast recently shared how veteran agents are using AI to conduct full business simplification audits. They're identifying the 20% of activities driving 80% of results, then having the courage to cut everything else. The outcome? Getting more accomplished in 30 focused hours than they previously did in 50 scattered ones.

The hardest part isn't identifying what should be eliminated — it's actually eliminating it. We hold onto ineffective strategies because stopping anything feels risky, even when those strategies haven't delivered results in years.

What's one business activity you continue doing out of habit rather than conviction?
