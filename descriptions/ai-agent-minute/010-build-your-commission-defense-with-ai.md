If you flinch when explaining your commission, you're already losing the client. Most agents still mumble something about "industry standards" and pray the conversation moves on — but post-NAR settlement, those days are over.

Here's the brutal truth: when you stumble through your value proposition, clients hear one thing loud and clear — even my own agent doesn't believe they're worth it. That hesitation is costing you deals and driving down your income.

The fix isn't complicated, but it requires you to do the work. Use AI to build a rock-solid 60-second value story based on YOUR actual numbers — your average days on market, your list-to-sale ratio, your track record. Then practice it until it flows naturally, not like you're reading from a script.

You don't have a commission problem. You have a value communication problem, and that's completely fixable.

What's your go-to response when a seller asks "why should I pay you that much?" Let's help each other get better at this crucial conversation.

The uncomfortable truth about real estate commissions in 2024: if you can't articulate your value in 60 seconds without hesitation, you're fighting an uphill battle you'll likely lose.

I've watched countless agents stumble through commission conversations post-NAR settlement, defaulting to vague references about "industry standards." Meanwhile, their prospects are hearing something entirely different — uncertainty from the very person asking to represent their largest asset.

The issue isn't your commission rate. It's your ability to communicate why that investment delivers measurable value. When you have concrete data — your average days on market versus market average, your list-to-sale price ratio, your marketing reach — the conversation shifts from cost justification to value demonstration.

Here's what's working: agents who use AI tools to craft compelling, data-driven value propositions based on their actual track record. Not generic scripts, but personalized stories that reflect their unique strengths and market performance.

The agents thriving in this new landscape aren't necessarily the cheapest — they're the clearest about their value.

How are you positioning your value in commission conversations today?
