Most real estate agents think the luxury market is some exclusive club they can't crack. But here's the truth: luxury clients choose agents based on expertise and credibility, not lucky connections.

The real trap? Waiting for that perfect referral to fall in your lap while doing zero preparation. When it finally comes, you're not ready for the conversation. Every year you wait is another year of sub-million-dollar transactions compounding in the wrong direction.

D.J. Paris breaks down how to use AI to build a 90-day luxury market entry strategy that focuses on expertise-building, luxury-specific marketing elements, and identifying luxury-adjacent clients already in your network. Stop hoping and start planning.

Here's an uncomfortable truth about the luxury real estate market: it's not closed to you because you lack connections. It's closed to you because you never built a plan to enter it.

Most agents fall into the same trap — waiting for that perfect luxury referral while developing zero expertise or credibility in the space. When the opportunity finally arrives, they're unprepared for the conversation. Luxury clients choose agents who already appear to belong in their world.

The cost of waiting? Every year of sub-million-dollar transactions compounds in the wrong direction while you hope for lucky breaks that may never come.

D.J. Paris outlines how AI can help you build a systematic 90-day luxury market entry strategy: defining specific target areas, developing market expertise before you have listings there, creating luxury-specific marketing materials, and identifying luxury-adjacent clients in your existing network.
