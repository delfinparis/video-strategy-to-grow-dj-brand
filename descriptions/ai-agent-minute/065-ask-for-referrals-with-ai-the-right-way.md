Most agents have 20+ happy past clients who would gladly send referrals - but never get asked properly. The typical "know anyone buying or selling?" approach feels like a sales pitch and gets forgotten instantly.

D.J. Paris breaks down the smart way: Use AI to craft 5 different referral request messages for different timing (post-closing, 6-month check-in, anniversary, etc.). Each one should be specific about who you're helping, easy to act on, and feel personal - not like a mass blast.

The key insight? Asking isn't awkward - NOT asking when clients want to help you is the real waste. Load these into your CRM and actually send them.

When's the last time you explicitly asked a past client for a referral?

Here's a hard truth: Most real estate professionals are sitting on a goldmine of potential referrals - but never tap into it properly.

The typical approach? A generic "know anyone looking to buy or sell?" That lands like a sales pitch, puts clients on the spot, and gets forgotten before they reach their car.

D.J. Paris shares a smarter strategy: leverage AI to create five distinct referral request messages for different touchpoints - post-closing, six-month check-ins, anniversaries, casual texts, and shareable social posts. The key is being specific about who you're trying to help while making it easy for clients to take action.

The insight that hit me: asking for referrals isn't awkward. NOT asking when your clients would be thrilled to help you grow your business - that's the real missed opportunity.

What's been your experience with referral requests? Have you found approaches that feel natural rather than transactional?
