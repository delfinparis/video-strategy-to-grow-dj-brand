Most real estate agents give up on leads after just 3 follow-ups. But here's what the data shows: buyers typically need 7+ touchpoints before they're ready to act. That means you're literally handing your next commission to the agent who doesn't quit.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down how AI can resurrect those "dead" leads sitting in your CRM. Spoiler alert: they're not dead — you just ran out of things to say.

The solution? Use Claude AI to create a 6-month re-engagement sequence that provides real value without being pushy. Market updates, neighborhood insights, helpful tips — everything that makes prospects think "this agent actually gets it."

Your next deal is already in your database. You just stopped showing up.

What's the longest you've ever nurtured a lead before they converted?

Here's a hard truth: The average real estate professional follows up with a lead exactly 3 times before marking them "cold." Meanwhile, industry research consistently shows that most buyers require 7 or more meaningful touchpoints before they're ready to make a decision.

We're not talking about a time management problem — we're talking about a creativity problem. Most agents don't run out of time to follow up; they run out of valuable things to say.

In this conversation with D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast, we explore how AI tools like Claude can solve this exact challenge. By feeding basic lead information into AI, you can generate months of value-driven follow-up content: neighborhood market updates, buying tips, local insights — all designed to keep you top-of-mind without being pushy.

The leads you wrote off last quarter? They're probably still looking, just working with the agent who didn't give up at touch #3.

What's been your experience with long-term lead nurturing? How many touchpoints do you typically make before moving on?
