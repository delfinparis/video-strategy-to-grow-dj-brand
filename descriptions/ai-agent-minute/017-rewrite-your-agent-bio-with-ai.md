Most real estate agent bios read like they were written by the same boring robot. "John has been helping buyers and sellers with a commitment to excellence..." Nobody cares. Nobody's reading past that first snooze-fest sentence.

Your bio isn't a resume collecting dust – it's your first sales pitch. It's what makes someone think "I need to call this person" versus "next..." And right now, most agent bios are doing the opposite of what they should be doing.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to use AI to rewrite your bio so it actually sounds like a human wrote it. The secret? Start with a story, not a credential list. Tell them why you got into real estate, who you serve best, and what you believe that other agents don't.

Does your current bio actually sound like YOU when you read it out loud?

Your agent bio is either making prospects want to call you – or putting them to sleep. Most are doing the second one 💤

D.J. Paris reveals why "15 years of commitment to excellence" bios are killing your lead gen. Your bio should read like your first sales conversation, not your LinkedIn resume.

The fix? Use AI to turn your real story into something that stops the scroll. Why you started, who you serve best, and what you believe that other agents don't.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about most real estate agent bios: they're written to prove the agent exists, not to make prospects want to call.

"John has been helping buyers and sellers in the greater metro area for fifteen years with a commitment to excellence and client satisfaction." Sound familiar? That's because 90% of agent bios follow this exact template. The result? Prospects keep scrolling.

Your bio isn't your resume. It's your first sales conversation. Top producers understand this distinction. Their bios don't just list credentials – they tell a story that makes a specific type of client think, "This is exactly who I need to work with."

The solution is simpler than you think. Use AI to help you craft a bio based on your real story: Why you got into real estate, what you love about the work, who you serve best, and what you believe about real estate that most agents would disagree with. These authentic details are what transform a generic bio into a lead-generation tool.

What would change in your business if your bio actually sounded like you and spoke directly to your ideal client?
