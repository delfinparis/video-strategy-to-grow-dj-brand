Buyers are signing representation agreements before seeing a single house post-NAR settlement — and many agents are losing clients in that first conversation because they can't explain their value clearly.

Here's what's happening: You're required to get that signature upfront, but buyers don't understand why they need it or what you actually do to earn your fee. If you stumble through this explanation, you're starting the relationship in a hole.

The fix? Use AI to build a confident, two-minute value conversation that sounds like a real person talking — not a legal disclosure. Practice until it feels natural.

How are you currently handling the buyer representation agreement conversation with new clients?

Post-NAR settlement: Agents are losing buyers before the first showing because they can't explain their value in 2 minutes 😬

Most agents still don't have clean language for why buyers need that representation agreement or what they do to earn their fee. The conversation happens upfront now — no more winging it.

The solution: Use AI to practice a confident value conversation that sounds human, not legal. Practice with pushback until it feels natural.

The NAR settlement created an unexpected challenge: agents are now losing potential clients in the first meeting, before showing a single property.

Here's what changed. Buyers must sign representation agreements upfront, but many don't understand why they need one or what agents do to justify their compensation. Without clear, confident language around your value proposition, you're starting every relationship at a disadvantage.

I'm seeing agents struggle through these conversations because they haven't adapted their approach to the new reality. The old "we'll figure it out later" method doesn't work when signatures are required upfront.

The solution involves using AI tools like Claude to develop and practice a natural, two-minute value conversation. Not legal jargon — real person language that builds confidence instead of confusion.

What's your current approach to the buyer representation agreement conversation? Are you finding buyers more or less receptive than expected?
