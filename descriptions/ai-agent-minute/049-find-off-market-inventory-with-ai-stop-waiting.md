Most agents blame low inventory for lost deals. But here's what top producers know: they're not finding hidden MLS gems everyone else missed — they're creating their own inventory pipeline.

The difference? While average agents wait for listings to appear, high performers are already talking to homeowners who haven't even decided to sell yet. They're building relationships with probate attorneys, reconnecting with old expireds, and using targeted outreach that most agents never try.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to use AI to build your own 10-point off-market strategy. No more "there's nothing to show" excuses.

What's your go-to method for finding off-market properties? Let's share strategies below! 👇

"There's nothing to show my buyers."

I hear this from agents constantly in tight markets. But here's the reality: the highest-performing agents aren't finding magical inventory that everyone else missed on the MLS.

They're generating it through systematic outreach and relationship-building that most agents never attempt because waiting for MLS listings feels easier.

The data is clear — agents who proactively create their own inventory pipeline through direct outreach, expired follow-ups, probate connections, and targeted social media consistently outperform their peers, even in the tightest markets.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how AI can help you build a comprehensive 10-point off-market strategy that goes far beyond hoping the perfect listing appears tomorrow.

What's been your most successful approach for connecting with potential sellers before they list? I'd love to hear what's working in your market.
