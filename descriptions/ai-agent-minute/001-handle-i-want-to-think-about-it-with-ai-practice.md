"I want to think about it" has cost you more commission than any market downturn ever will. Those five words kill more deals than bad inventory or high interest rates combined.

The agents who handle this objection smoothly aren't smarter or more experienced. They just practiced more. When pressure hits, your brain defaults to the safest response - which is usually silence, agreement, and watching your commission walk out the door.

Here's the game changer: AI role-play practice. Spend 15 minutes weekly with Claude acting as a hesitant seller. Let it push back, create real objections, and force you to think on your feet. By the time you're in the actual conversation, you've already been there a hundred times.

D.J. Paris breaks down exactly how to set this up and turn objection handling into an automatic response instead of a panic moment.

Every real estate professional has heard those five words: "I want to think about it." And for most of us, it signals the beginning of the end for that deal.

Here's what I've learned after 700+ podcast episodes interviewing top agents: The ones who handle objections effortlessly aren't necessarily more experienced or talented. They're simply better rehearsed. When pressure hits, we default to our practiced responses - or lack thereof.

The breakthrough insight from D.J. Paris at Kale Realty? Use AI as your unlimited practice partner. Fifteen minutes weekly with Claude, role-playing as a hesitant seller, can transform your objection handling from reactive scrambling to confident, automatic responses.

In today's competitive market, the difference between closing and losing often comes down to those crucial moments when buyers or sellers express hesitation. The agents who've rehearsed their responses in a safe environment are the ones who don't freeze when it matters most.
