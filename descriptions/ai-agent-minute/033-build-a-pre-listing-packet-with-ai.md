Most agents show up to listing appointments with just a CMA and hope to build credibility in 45 minutes while competing against 3 other agents. They're making it way harder than it needs to be.

The top listing agents change the entire dynamic before they even ring the doorbell. They send a strategic pre-listing packet 2 days before the appointment using AI tools like Claude. Instead of walking into an audition, they're walking into a conversation with someone who already feels like they know them.

DJ Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to build this packet in 20 minutes - your bio as a compelling story (not a credential list), comparable sales, testimonials, marketing overview, and the 5 questions you'll ask. By the time you arrive, you're not starting from zero.

What do you currently send to sellers before your listing appointments? Are you making it harder on yourself than it needs to be?

🏠 The listing appointment starts before you ring the doorbell (most agents don't know this)

DJ Paris shows exactly how to build one in 20 minutes: compelling bio story + comps + testimonials + marketing overview + your 5 questions. Result? You walk into a conversation, not an audition.

The most successful listing agents understand something their competitors miss: the appointment starts before you ring the doorbell.

While most agents show up with a folder and a CMA, hoping to build credibility and close the listing in one 45-minute presentation, top performers have already shifted the entire dynamic. They've sent a strategic pre-listing packet two days prior.

DJ Paris demonstrates how Claude AI can build this packet in just 20 minutes. It includes your bio written as a compelling story (not a credential list), comparable sales that frame your pricing approach, relevant testimonials, a marketing overview, and the five key questions you'll ask during the appointment.

The result? By the time you arrive, the seller already feels like they know you. You're not walking into an audition - you're walking into a conversation between equals. That's a fundamentally different appointment with much higher close rates.

What materials, if any, do you currently provide to prospects before your listing presentations? How are you differentiating yourself before you even walk through the door?
