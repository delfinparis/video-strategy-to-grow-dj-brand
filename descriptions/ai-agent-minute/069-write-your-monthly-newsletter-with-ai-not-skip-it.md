Your email list is one of your most valuable business assets — yet most agents send exactly ONE email per year (at Christmas). While you've been silent for 11 months, other agents are showing up in your clients' inboxes every single week.

When your past client's neighbor asks for a real estate referral, you're not the first name that comes to mind. Not because you didn't do great work — because you've been invisible.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down how to create a monthly newsletter in just 20 minutes using AI. One market data point + one seasonal tip + one personal story + a recent win = a five-paragraph email that keeps you top of mind when it matters most.

Consistency beats perfection every time. Do you send monthly emails to your database — yes, sometimes, or never?

Most real estate professionals treat their email database like a holiday card list — one message per year, sent in December. Meanwhile, their past clients and sphere of influence receive consistent communication from other agents, mortgage brokers, and service providers every single week.

The harsh reality? When a referral opportunity arises, you're not the first name that comes to mind. Not because you didn't deliver exceptional service, but because you've been invisible for eleven consecutive months.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how AI can transform this common failure point into a competitive advantage. Using Claude AI, agents can create meaningful monthly newsletters in just 20 minutes by combining four simple elements: one local market insight, one seasonal home maintenance tip, one personal business story, and one recent success or listing.

The key is consistency over perfection. Monthly touchpoints build the top-of-mind awareness that drives referrals and repeat business. It's not about perfect design or corporate messaging — it's about genuine, regular connection.

How often do you communicate with your entire database via email — monthly, occasionally, or only during the holidays?
