Every "yes" you say to the wrong thing is a "no" to something that actually matters. Most veteran agents built their reputation on being available 24/7 — but accidentally trained clients to treat their time as free.

The result? You're fielding 9 PM texts, weekend calls for non-emergencies, and on-demand showings that could wait. Meanwhile, your best clients get whatever energy you have left.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares a simple AI hack using Claude to create a "communication expectations" document. It's not about setting boundaries — it's about creating systems that let you serve your top clients at the highest level.

Have you ever lost a deal because you were too spread thin managing everyone's small requests?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: Every "yes" you say to the wrong thing is a "no" to something that actually matters.

I see veteran agents trapped in this cycle daily. They built stellar reputations on availability and responsiveness. But success created a monster — clients now expect 9 PM texts, weekend calls for non-emergencies, and on-demand everything.

The cruelest irony? The more available you become for everyone, the less present you can be for clients who deserve your best work. Your top-tier clients get whatever energy remains after managing everyone else's urgent-but-not-important requests.

The solution isn't traditional boundary-setting. It's systems. Use AI tools like Claude to create a professional "communication expectations" document for new clients. Frame it as how you work best, not what you won't do.

Great agents don't just work hard — they protect the time that makes their work great.

What's one small request that constantly derails your focus from high-value activities?
