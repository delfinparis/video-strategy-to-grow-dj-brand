Most agents sound like they're reading from a training manual because they literally are. They're using scripts written for someone else, and buyers can feel that disconnect in the first 15 seconds of any call.

Here's the truth: your brain creates a half-second delay before every borrowed line, checking its memory instead of connecting with the person. That tiny pause? It kills trust instantly.

Top producers don't use other people's scripts - they sound authentically like themselves. And now AI can help you build prospecting scripts in YOUR voice, not some guru's version of what "works."

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to use Claude to create opening scripts that sound naturally like you - because authenticity is your biggest competitive advantage in prospecting.

What's your current go-to opening line when you call prospects?
