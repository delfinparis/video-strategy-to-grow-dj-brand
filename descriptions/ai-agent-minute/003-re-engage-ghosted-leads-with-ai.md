Your last message to that ghosted lead? It probably gave them zero reason to respond. "Just following up" and "wanted to check in" are exactly why clients disappear – they feel pressure, not value.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down why leads don't actually ghost agents they find valuable. They ghost agents they feel pressure from. The solution isn't chasing harder – it's giving them a compelling reason to come back.

His three-touch AI sequence flips the script: relevant market update, specific property match, then a low-pressure check-in asking if you're still being helpful. Every message delivers value without making them feel guilty for going quiet.

Stop chasing. Start delivering value they can't ignore.

Here's an uncomfortable truth: if your leads are ghosting you, your follow-up strategy is the problem, not their interest level.

Most agents respond to radio silence with more of the same – "just checking in," "wanted to follow up," "haven't heard from you." Every single message screams desperation and creates pressure. And clients don't ghost valuable advisors. They ghost salespeople who make them uncomfortable.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shares a counterintuitive approach that actually works. Instead of chasing harder, top producers give ghosted leads a compelling reason to re-engage through pure value delivery.

His AI-powered three-touch sequence flips the dynamic entirely: start with a relevant market insight, follow with a perfectly matched property, then check in by asking if you're still being helpful. No guilt. No pressure. Just undeniable value that makes responding feel natural.

How many qualified leads are currently sitting silent in your CRM because your last interaction felt like pressure instead of partnership?
