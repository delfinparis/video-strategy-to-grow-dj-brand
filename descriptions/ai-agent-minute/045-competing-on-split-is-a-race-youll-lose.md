Most team leaders think they're differentiating themselves with their commission split. The truth? If your only recruiting advantage is percentage points, you're in a race to the bottom that someone else will always win.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down why the agents worth recruiting aren't choosing teams based on splits. They're choosing based on whether they believe your team will actually make them better at what they do.

The solution isn't a better split – it's answering four critical questions about what makes your team genuinely different. When you can articulate your unique value, your agents can too, and referrals start flowing naturally.

What's your current one-line answer to "why should I join your team over any other option?" Let's workshop it together in the comments.

Here's an uncomfortable truth about real estate recruiting: if your pitch sounds like everyone else's, you've already lost the best candidates.

Most team leaders default to the same three selling points: great leads, competitive split, strong support. The problem? Every team leader in your market is saying exactly the same thing. You're not differentiating – you're commoditizing.

D.J. Paris, who's conducted 700+ podcast interviews with top performers, recently shared a framework that cuts through this noise. The agents worth recruiting aren't making decisions based on commission splits. They're evaluating whether your team will genuinely accelerate their career growth.

Before crafting your next recruiting message, answer these four questions: What specific type of agent is your team designed to help? What unique value do you provide? What's the clear career trajectory? What does your culture actually feel like on an average Tuesday?

When you can articulate these answers clearly, your current agents can too – and referrals start flowing naturally. The best recruiting pitch doesn't appeal to everyone; it speaks so directly to your ideal agent that they feel like you wrote it specifically for them.

What's your current elevator pitch for why top agents should choose your team?
