Most real estate agents are literally guessing with their own business. After 12 years of interviewing top producers on my podcast, I can tell you that 95% of agents can't answer this simple question: What's your cost per closed deal by lead source?

Without that number, every marketing decision is a coin flip. You could be pouring thousands into Zillow leads that never close while ignoring referral systems that actually pay off. Top producers don't necessarily spend more on leads — they spend smarter because they actually track where their money goes.

Here's the 30-minute fix using AI: Export your last 24 months of closed deals from your CRM, paste it into Claude, and ask it to analyze your ROI by lead source. It'll spot patterns you've been too busy to see.

When's the last time you actually audited your lead source ROI? Be brutally honest — most of us are flying blind on this.

95% of agents can't tell you their cost per closed deal by lead source — they're literally guessing with their own business 😬

After 12 years interviewing top producers, here's what separates them: they track EVERYTHING. While most agents throw money at Zillow and hope for the best, top producers know exactly which sources actually close.

The fix? Export 24 months of deals from your CRM → paste into Claude → ask for ROI analysis by lead source. Takes 30 minutes, saves thousands.

Here's an uncomfortable truth: Most real estate professionals are making marketing decisions with zero data to back them up.

In 12 years of hosting my podcast and talking to hundreds of agents, I've learned that fewer than 5% can tell you their actual cost per closed deal by lead source. Think about that — we're running businesses where every marketing dollar is essentially a guess.

This isn't just inefficient; it's expensive. Agents routinely spend thousands on lead sources that sound promising but deliver poor ROI, while neglecting channels that actually convert. The difference between struggling agents and top producers isn't necessarily budget size — it's tracking precision.

The solution is simpler than you think: Export your last 24 months of closed deals, including lead source data, and let AI analyze the patterns. Claude can spot ROI trends in minutes that would take you hours to calculate manually.

What surprises most agents is discovering that their best ROI often comes from sources they've been underinvesting in. Data-driven decisions beat gut instincts every time.

When did you last run a comprehensive ROI analysis on your lead sources?
