70% of buyers say they'd use their agent again. Only 11% actually do. That gap isn't disloyalty—it's neglect.

Most agents vanish after closing. You send a thank-you gift, then disappear into thin air. Six months later, when your past client's neighbor needs a realtor recommendation, they can't remember your last name. Not because you did bad work—because you went silent.

Here's the game-changer: Use AI to build a 12-month automated check-in sequence. Personal messages, market updates, maintenance tips—all scheduled to send automatically. Your clients feel remembered without you lifting a finger.

Your past clients are your goldmine. Don't lose them to your own silence.

When's the last time you reached out to a past client just to check in—not to sell anything?

Here's a sobering reality check for real estate professionals: 70% of buyers say they'd use their agent again, but only 11% actually do.

This isn't about service quality or market competition. It's about something far more controllable—post-closing silence. Most agents send a thank-you gift and then vanish. Six months later, when that satisfied client's neighbor needs a recommendation, your name draws a blank.

We're losing our most valuable asset—past clients—not to competitors, but to our own neglect. The solution isn't more prospecting calls or expensive lead generation. It's systematic follow-up that feels personal but runs automatically.

AI tools like Claude can help you build a 12-month check-in sequence in under 20 minutes. Personal notes, market updates, maintenance reminders—all scheduled to nurture relationships without constant manual effort.

How are you staying top-of-mind with your past clients beyond the closing table?
