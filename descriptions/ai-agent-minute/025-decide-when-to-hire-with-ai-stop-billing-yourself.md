You're billing yourself at $15/hour when your time is worth $200/hour. Every day you do tasks someone else could handle for fifteen bucks, you're literally paying yourself minimum wage instead of building a million-dollar business.

D.J. Paris breaks down the math that separates desperate agents from data-driven top producers. Most agents wait until they're drowning to hire help – then make every rookie mistake. The smart move? Use AI to analyze your task list and calculate the exact moment hiring makes financial sense.

Your first hire isn't an expense. It's the investment that transforms you from an agent into a business owner who scales with systems, not stress.

What's the one task eating up your time that you know someone else could handle? Let's talk about it.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: You're doing $15/hour work when your expertise is worth $200/hour.

I see this pattern constantly in real estate. Agents spend prime hours on administrative tasks, lead follow-up that could be systematized, and busy work that keeps them from revenue-generating activities. They're literally paying themselves minimum wage.

The biggest mistake? Waiting until you're overwhelmed to hire help. By then, you make desperate decisions: wrong person, unclear role, no systems in place. Top producers hire strategically, based on data, not desperation.

Here's the AI hack that changes everything: List every task from last week with time invested. Ask Claude to categorize high-value work vs. tasks an assistant could handle, plus calculate your opportunity cost. The math will tell you exactly when hiring becomes profitable.

Your first hire isn't an expense – it's the pivot point from agent to business owner. It's how you start scaling systems instead of just working harder.

What's the biggest time-drain keeping you from high-value activities right now?
