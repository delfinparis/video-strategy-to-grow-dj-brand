Most team leaders spend thousands recruiting agents and almost nothing on onboarding — then wonder why 70% leave in the first 90 days. The brutal truth? Those agents don't blame themselves when they quit. They blame you.

In this episode of Keeping It Real Podcast, D.J. Paris reveals why your onboarding process is actually your retention strategy. New agents don't leave because of commission splits — they leave because nobody showed them what to do on day two.

The solution is simpler than you think. Using AI tools like Claude, you can build a structured 90-day onboarding program in minutes that gives every new agent the same guided experience from day one.

What's the biggest gap in how you currently onboard new team members?

Your agents aren't leaving for better splits — they're leaving because you failed them on day two 💯

Most team leaders invest thousands in recruiting but $0 in onboarding. Then they act shocked when new agents quietly start looking elsewhere before closing their first deal.

The fix? A structured 90-day program that treats onboarding like the retention strategy it actually is. Because the investment you make in an agent's first 90 days determines if they'll still be on your team in year three.

Here's a hard truth most real estate team leaders won't admit: The agents leaving your team in the first 90 days aren't quitting because of commission structure. They're quitting because of poor onboarding.

I've interviewed hundreds of top-producing team leaders over 12 years hosting Keeping It Real Podcast. The common thread among those with lowest turnover? They treat onboarding as a retention strategy, not an HR checkbox.

Most teams spend thousands recruiting agents, then drop them into chaos on day one. The new agent joins excited, figures things out alone, and starts looking elsewhere before their first closing. Here's what stings: when they leave, they don't blame themselves — they blame leadership.

The solution involves building structured 90-day programs with weekly milestones, resource checklists, and mentor pairings. Tools like Claude can draft these systems in minutes, giving every new agent the same guided experience from day one.

The investment you make in an agent's first 90 days determines whether they're contributing to your team in year three. What's the biggest gap in your current onboarding process?
