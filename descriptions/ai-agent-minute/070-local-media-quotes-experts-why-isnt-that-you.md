Most real estate agents watch local news quote some "expert" and think that door is forever closed to them. Plot twist: those journalists are actually desperate for reliable sources and often working on deadline with nobody to call.

D.J. Paris breaks down why one media quote creates more credibility than any ad budget ever could. The secret? Journalists don't find you - you have to find them first. And AI can help you craft the perfect pitch.

He shares a specific Claude prompt to create five targeted media pitches this week: local newspaper, podcast, lifestyle blog, newsletter, and radio/TV. Not "I'm a great agent" but "here's the angle I can give you on today's rate environment."

One yes changes everything. You don't need to be famous - just useful at the right moment.

Every time you see a local news story quoting a real estate expert, ask yourself: why isn't that you?

Most agents assume media coverage is reserved for the already-famous. The truth? Local journalists, podcasters, and bloggers are constantly hunting for credible sources on deadline. They need someone who can provide intelligent commentary on mortgage rates, inventory reports, and market conditions.

D.J. Paris shares a game-changing insight: one legitimate media quote creates more credibility than any paid advertising campaign. But here's what separates the quoted from the overlooked - you have to make the first move.

His solution is brilliantly practical: use AI to craft five targeted media pitches this week. Not generic "I'm available" emails, but specific angles on timely topics. "Here's my take on the current rate environment" beats "I'm a great agent" every single time.

The barrier isn't your credentials or connections. It's simply taking action. One yes permanently elevates your professional profile.

What's your experience with local media coverage - and what's been holding you back from pursuing it?
