Most new construction buyers think they're saving money by skipping the agent. What they don't realize? The friendly person at the sales office works for the builder — not them. They're literally paid by the person sitting across the table.

Here's what buyers miss without representation: upgrade credits, lot premium negotiations, closing cost concessions, and extended rate locks. These opportunities exist in every new construction deal, but only if you know how to ask for them.

The result? Buyers sign contracts they don't fully understand and miss out on thousands in savings and protections. But agents who specialize in new construction can change that entire dynamic.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down exactly how to become the agent who protects buyers in these deals — and how AI can help you build the expertise fast.

The builder's onsite agent is paid by the builder. Not your buyer. 🏠

Most new construction buyers think they don't need representation — until they realize the "helpful" sales agent can't negotiate against their own employer.

There are real opportunities in every new construction deal: upgrade credits, lot premiums, closing concessions, extended rate locks. But buyers won't know these exist without an agent who specializes in this space.

Here's a costly misconception: New construction buyers think they don't need representation because there's already an agent onsite.

The reality? That onsite agent is employed by the builder. They're friendly, professional, and entirely paid by the person sitting across the table from your client. They cannot — and will not — negotiate against their employer.

What buyers miss without proper representation is significant: upgrade credits, lot premium reductions, closing cost concessions, extended rate locks. These opportunities exist in every deal, but only experienced buyer's agents know how to identify and pursue them.

The consequence? Buyers sign builder contracts they don't fully understand, missing thousands in potential savings and protections they'll pay for over decades.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how agents can use AI to quickly build expertise in new construction transactions — becoming the knowledgeable advocate buyers actually need in these complex deals.
