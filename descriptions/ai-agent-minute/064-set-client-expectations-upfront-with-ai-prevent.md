Here's a sobering reality: 90% of client problems in real estate stem from expectations that were never properly established at the beginning of the relationship.

The late-night texts, the frustrated "why wasn't I told about this?" calls, the clients who expect immediate responses on weekends — these aren't inevitable parts of the business. They're symptoms of a broken system.

While most agents hope their clients will naturally understand the process, top producers take a different approach. They proactively set clear expectations before any issues arise.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how AI tools like Claude can help you create a comprehensive client expectations document. This simple 2-page resource covers communication protocols, transaction timelines, client responsibilities, and prepares buyers and sellers for the most common surprises they'll encounter.

Setting expectations isn't defensive — it's the foundation of exceptional client service.
