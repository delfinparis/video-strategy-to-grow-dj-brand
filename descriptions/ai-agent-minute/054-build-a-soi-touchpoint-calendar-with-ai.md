Most agents contact their top 20 referral sources maybe 2-3 times per year. Then wonder why referrals go to someone else. 

The brutal truth? Other agents aren't getting more referrals because they have better relationships. They have better SYSTEMS for maintaining them. While you're thinking about calling someone (then not calling, feeling guilty, and avoiding it again), they're showing up consistently in that person's world.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down the AI-powered touchpoint calendar that turns your sphere of influence into a referral-generating machine. It's not about being pushy — it's about being systematic.

The agents crushing it with referrals don't leave staying top-of-mind to chance. They leave it to design.

How many times did you actually contact your top 20 contacts last year? Be brutally honest.

Most agents contact their top 20 referral sources 2-3 times per year. Then wonder why referrals go elsewhere 🤔

You don't stay top of mind by accident. You stay top of mind by DESIGN. 

The agents crushing it with referrals don't have better relationships — they have better systems. While you're thinking about calling someone (then not calling and feeling guilty), they're systematically showing up every single month.

POV: You think about calling your sphere, don't call, feel guilty, then avoid thinking about it again 😅 Meanwhile another agent has been systematically showing up in their world every month.

The uncomfortable truth about referrals: They don't go to the agent with the best relationships. They go to the agent who's systematically maintained visibility.

I see this pattern constantly in real estate. An agent has incredible relationships but contacts their top 20 referral sources maybe twice a year. Meanwhile, another agent — perhaps with weaker personal connections — has built a touchpoint system that keeps them visible every month.

When someone needs a referral recommendation, they don't dig through their memory for the "nicest" agent they know. They recommend whoever comes to mind first. And that's almost always the agent who's been consistently present.

D.J. Paris shares a brilliant AI-powered approach to building a sphere of influence touchpoint calendar. It's not about being pushy or inauthentic — it's about being systematic in your relationship maintenance.

The agents building referral-based businesses understand this: You don't stay top of mind by accident. You stay top of mind by design.

What's your honest assessment — how often do you contact your most valuable referral sources?
