Most real estate agents lose deals three months in and never understand why. The truth? It started in the very first conversation they never fully had with their buyer.

Here's what happens: agents rush to start showing houses because they think that's what buyers want. But without a proper consultation, buyers enter the process with unrealistic expectations, no understanding of market realities, and zero appreciation for your expertise.

Three months later when the deal falls apart, you're wondering what went wrong. But the real question is: what conversation didn't happen at the beginning? A structured buyer consultation saves you 30+ hours of frustration down the road.

DJ Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down how to use AI to prep for bulletproof buyer consultations that set clear expectations from day one.

Do you have a formal buyer consultation process, or do you wing it with every new client?

The pattern is predictable: agents rush to start showing properties, skip the comprehensive buyer consultation, and then wonder why deals fall apart three months later.

Here's what I've learned after 700+ podcast episodes interviewing top real estate professionals: every buyer challenge—ghosting, cold feet, unrealistic expectations—traces back to an incomplete initial conversation.

The math is simple: invest one hour in a structured buyer consultation or spend 30+ hours dealing with the consequences later. Most agents choose door number two without realizing it.

DJ Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates how artificial intelligence can help agents prepare bulletproof consultations that set proper expectations from day one. The key is using AI to anticipate the right questions, market realities, and potential friction points before they derail your transaction.

What's your approach to buyer consultations—structured process or adapt on the fly?
