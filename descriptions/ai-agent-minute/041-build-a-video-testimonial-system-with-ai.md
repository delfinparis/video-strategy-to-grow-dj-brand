Most real estate agents have dozens of happy clients but zero video testimonials. Here's the brutal truth: a 60-second video from a satisfied client will sell your services better than anything you could ever say about yourself.

The problem isn't that clients won't do it - it's that we make it awkward and complicated. We don't give them a script, we don't make the ask feel natural, and we let the moment pass when the deal closes.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast breaks down the exact system top agents use to collect video testimonials consistently. It's not about hoping clients film something - it's about having a frictionless process that makes it easy for them to say yes.

The secret? Give them three specific questions to answer and simple filming instructions. Most people actually WANT to help you succeed - they just need to know what to say.

How many video testimonials do you currently have in your marketing arsenal?

Here's what separates successful real estate professionals from the rest: they have a system for collecting video testimonials, not just hope that clients will provide them.

A 60-second video from a satisfied client carries more credibility than any marketing copy you could write about yourself. Yet most agents close deals and walk away with nothing but a handshake - missing the most powerful conversion tool in their arsenal.

The issue isn't client willingness. It's our approach. When we make the ask feel awkward, provide no guidance on what to say, and overcomplicate the filming process, we create unnecessary friction. The moment passes, the deal closes, and the opportunity disappears.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast reveals the systematic approach top agents use: three specific questions that guide the client's response, simple phone filming instructions, and a natural ask that feels like a favor between friends, not a business transaction.

The key insight? Giving clients a script isn't cheesy - it's helpful. Most people genuinely want to support your success but need direction on how to articulate their experience effectively.

What's your current process for collecting client testimonials, and how has it impacted your business growth?
