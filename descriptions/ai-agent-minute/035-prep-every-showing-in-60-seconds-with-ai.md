Most agents walk into showings with the exact same information their buyers already have - the MLS sheet. Meanwhile, top producers show up with neighborhood price trends, recent comps, and smart questions for the listing agent.

The difference? Sixty seconds with AI before every showing. D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast shows exactly how to use Claude or Perplexity to pull comparable sales, price trajectories, public records, and strategic questions that make you look like the most prepared agent in the room.

Your buyers don't want someone reading the brochure alongside them. They want an expert who did their homework.

What's your current showing prep process - and how long does it take you?

Here's an uncomfortable truth: Most real estate agents walk into showings with the exact same information their buyers already downloaded from Zillow.

While you're both reading the property brochure, your credibility as the "expert in the room" quietly erodes. Your buyers expect context, market insights, and strategic guidance - not someone discovering the square footage alongside them.

D.J. Paris from Keeping It Real Podcast demonstrates a 60-second AI workflow that transforms your showing preparation. Using Claude or Perplexity, you can instantly pull comparable sales, neighborhood price trajectories, relevant public records, and strategic questions for the listing agent.

The result? You walk in with context while other agents wing it. That level of preparation builds the kind of trust that creates loyal clients for life.

What's one insight or data point you wish you had access to before every showing?
