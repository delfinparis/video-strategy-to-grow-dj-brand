Most agents have closed dozens of happy clients but only have 3-5 Google reviews. Here's the uncomfortable truth: that's not because your clients weren't grateful—it's because you don't have a system.

The top producers with 60+ reviews didn't get luckier clients. They built a simple sequence that makes leaving a review the easiest thing their client does all week. While most agents cross their fingers and hope, these agents have AI create a 5-step follow-up system with perfect timing, direct links, and one-sentence prompts that tell clients exactly what to say.

Your reviews work as your sales team 24/7. Every future client sees them before they ever call you.

How many Google reviews do you currently have? Drop the number below—no judgment, just curious where everyone's starting from!

Your clients aren't leaving reviews because you made it hard—not because they're ungrateful 😬

The agents with 80+ reviews have one thing you don't: a systematic follow-up sequence that makes saying "yes" to a review request easier than saying no.

Most agents hope for reviews. Top producers build systems with AI that include perfect timing, direct links, and one-sentence prompts telling clients exactly what to mention.

POV: You've closed 50+ happy clients but only have 4 Google reviews 💀 It's not them—it's your system (or lack of one)

I've talked to agents who've closed 100+ transactions but have fewer than 10 Google reviews. The issue isn't client satisfaction—it's system failure.

Here's what separates agents with 5 reviews from those with 50+: intentional follow-up sequences. The high-review agents don't hope clients remember to leave feedback. They create frictionless systems that include optimal timing, direct links, and specific prompts telling clients exactly what to mention.

Think about it: your reviews are working as unpaid sales staff, building trust with prospects before they ever call. Yet most agents treat review collection as an afterthought rather than a revenue-generating system.

The agents crushing it online have learned to leverage AI tools like Claude to build sophisticated follow-up sequences that feel personal while being systematic. They've turned social proof into a predictable business asset.

What's your current Google review count, and what system (if any) do you have for requesting them?
