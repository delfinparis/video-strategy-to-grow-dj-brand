Most real estate team meetings accomplish one thing: wasting everyone's time together instead of separately. Sound familiar? That painful "does anyone have anything else?" that stretches for 30 minutes while everyone checks their phones.

Here's what D.J. Paris discovered: The difference between teams that multiply productivity and teams that drain it comes down to one thing - the agenda. And whether anyone built it on purpose.

Instead of winging it, smart team leaders now use AI to structure meetings that actually move the needle. Wins celebration, metrics review, focused training, real decisions, and specific next actions. All in 45 minutes, no filler.

What's the biggest time-waster in your current team meetings? Let's get honest about what's really happening in those conference rooms.

The average real estate team meeting accomplishes one thing remarkably well: wasting everyone's time together instead of separately.

I've observed hundreds of team leaders over the years, and there's a clear pattern. The ones struggling with team productivity run meetings by feel - status updates that could be emails, endless "does anyone have anything else?" segments, and motivational speeches that fade by Tuesday.

The teams with real traction? They run meetings on structure. They use tools like Claude AI to build focused agendas before every meeting: wins celebration, metrics review, one training topic, actual decisions that need the whole team, and specific next actions for each person. Forty-five minutes, no filler.

Here's what I've learned: A well-run team meeting multiplies productivity. A poorly-run one drains it. The difference is always whether someone built the agenda on purpose.

What's the biggest productivity drain in your current team meetings? I'm curious to hear what's really happening behind closed doors.
