A $40 million producer in Chicago just confessed something that might shock you: she's terrible at CRM. But here's the genius part – she found a stupidly simple fix that changed everything.

Bari Mill doesn't spend hours catching up on her database like most agents do. Instead, she sets a 10-minute timer every single day and treats it like brushing her teeth. Boring, non-negotiable, done before she can talk herself out of it.

Think about it: 10 minutes today versus 3 hours of panic next month when you realize your pipeline is a mess. The agents crushing it aren't superhuman – they just don't let the boring stuff pile up into a crisis.

What's one "boring" business task you keep putting off that could be solved with a daily 10-minute timer?

A top Chicago real estate producer closing $40 million annually just shared something that might surprise you: she openly admits to being terrible at CRM management.

But here's where it gets interesting. Instead of fighting her natural tendencies, Bari Mill created a system that works with her personality, not against it. She sets a 10-minute timer every day and updates her database before she can talk herself out of it.

The brilliance isn't in the complexity – it's in the simplicity. She treats it like brushing her teeth: boring, non-negotiable, and done quickly. No more Sunday afternoon database marathons. No more three-hour panic sessions when deals start falling through the cracks.

This highlights a critical business principle: the agents producing at the highest levels aren't necessarily the most naturally organized or disciplined. They're simply the ones who've figured out sustainable systems that prevent small tasks from becoming major problems.

What's one essential business activity you're avoiding that could be transformed with a simple daily timer?
