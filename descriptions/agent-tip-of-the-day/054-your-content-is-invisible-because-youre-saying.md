### FACEBOOK

Your content isn't getting engagement because you're essentially copy-pasting Google. Award-winning video coach Kim Rittberg works with top producers and she's brutally honest: "Everyone has Google. Don't just take the phone to the internet and say it."

The agents getting calls aren't posting the most content—they're posting content with a point of view. When rates drop, don't just announce it. Tell people if NOW is the time to buy or wait. When a house sits, explain WHY it's sitting and what that means for buyers.

People don't hire information. They hire perspective. Your take beats Google's facts every single time.

Stop being a search engine. Start being an expert 🎯

Your content is invisible because you're saying what Google already said. Market stats, rate updates, generic tips—nobody needs YOU for that.

The agents getting calls? They have opinions. They take stands. They give perspective, not just information.

I've watched thousands of real estate professionals struggle with content that gets zero engagement. The problem isn't posting frequency—it's perspective.

Award-winning video coach Kim Rittberg put it perfectly: "Everyone has Google. Don't just take the phone to the internet and say it. What is YOUR opinion, what is YOUR take?"

The data is clear: agents who share opinions get calls. Agents who share Google-able information get ignored. When interest rates shift, don't just announce it—tell people what it means for their specific situation. When properties sit on the market, explain the WHY behind it.

People don't hire information repositories. They hire trusted advisors with informed perspectives. Your expertise isn't in knowing the facts—it's in interpreting what those facts mean for your clients' unique situations.

What's the most contrarian opinion you hold about today's real estate market that actually serves your clients better?
