If you switched brokerages tomorrow, how many of your clients would actually follow you? That number reveals everything about whether you've built a real business or just borrowed someone else's credibility.

Real estate tech strategist Chris Linsell just dropped some uncomfortable truth: your clients don't give a damn about your brokerage logo. They remember YOU—the agent who answered at 9 PM, knew their neighborhood inside out, and made them feel heard during the biggest transaction of their lives.

Think about your last five closings. Did anyone choose you because of Keller Williams or RE/MAX on your card? Or because you showed up, followed through, and earned their trust one conversation at a time?

The agents surviving industry chaos—mergers, acquisitions, office closures—are the ones clients remember by name, not by logo. Your personal brand isn't marketing fluff. It's your insurance policy.

What's one thing you do that makes clients remember YOU specifically, not just your brokerage?

Here's a gut-check question every real estate professional needs to answer: If you switched brokerages tomorrow, how many of your clients would follow you?

That number isn't just vanity metrics—it's your actual brand equity. And according to real estate tech strategist Chris Linsell, it reveals whether you've built a sustainable business or simply borrowed credibility from someone else's logo.

The uncomfortable truth? Your clients have never cared about whether you're with Compass, Keller Williams, or RE/MAX. They chose you because you answered the phone at 9 PM, knew their neighborhood's price history, showed up to every appointment on time, and made them feel heard during their biggest financial decision.

The agents who survive industry consolidation, mergers, and market shifts are the ones clients remember by name. When your office closes or your brokerage gets acquired, are you still in business? Or were you renting someone else's reputation the whole time?

Your personal brand isn't marketing fluff—it's your insurance policy in an increasingly volatile industry.

What's the one thing you do consistently that makes clients choose you over the competition?
