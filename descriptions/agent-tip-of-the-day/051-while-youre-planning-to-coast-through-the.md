While 80% of real estate agents are planning their holiday break, the top 5% are sharpening their weapons. December isn't downtime—it's separation season.

Think about it: your competitors disappear, the market quiets down, and everyone tells themselves they'll "go hard in January." Meanwhile, smart agents are calling past clients, texting their sphere, and door-knocking expired listings on Saturday mornings when no one else will.

The gap between average agents and top producers doesn't widen in January when everyone's hustling again. It widens RIGHT NOW, while everyone else is coasting. They're building the pipeline that explodes in Q1 while others are scrambling to catch up.

Paul Salter, mindset coach to top producers, breaks down exactly how to use these winter months as your competitive advantage. One simple strategy: pull every client who closed in the last 12 months and send them a 15-second voice note before lunch tomorrow. Not selling—just showing up.

What's your plan for separation season? Are you coasting or competing?

While you're planning to coast through the holidays, someone else is planning to bury you 💀

December isn't downtime—it's separation season. While 80% of agents disappear, the top 5% are using winter as their secret weapon.

They're not waiting for January motivation. They're calling past clients, door-knocking expired listings on Saturdays, and building pipelines that explode in Q1. The gap between you and them widens RIGHT NOW, not in the New Year.

Every December, the same pattern emerges in real estate: 80% of agents use the holidays as an excuse to slow down, while the top 5% use it as their competitive advantage.

Paul Salter, mindset coach to top producers, calls this "separation season"—and it's not what you think. The gap between average and exceptional agents doesn't widen in January when everyone's motivated again. It widens right now, while competitors are coasting.

Smart agents aren't waiting for New Year resolutions. They're calling past clients who closed six months ago, texting sphere contacts they haven't reached since summer, and door-knocking expired listings on Saturday mornings. They're building the pipeline that explodes in Q1 while others scramble to catch up.

The market may slow down in winter, but your effort doesn't have to. One simple strategy: tomorrow morning, pull every client who closed in the last 12 months and send them a personal 15-second voice note. Not to sell—just to show up. That's separation.

The question isn't whether December will be slower. It's whether you'll use that slowness as fuel or as an excuse. Which agent will you be this separation season?
