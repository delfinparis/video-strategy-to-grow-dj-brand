The top 1% of real estate agents aren't the ones texting back fastest anymore. Carrie McCormick, a Chicago luxury producer with 20+ years in the business, just saved her client $40K by walking away from a "perfect" deal. While other agents were rushing to close, she was reading board minutes and doing math.

Here's what happened: Full-price offer accepted, clean inspection, pre-approved buyer. But buried in the building's board minutes? Two special assessments totaling $40K. The fast agent closes and deals with fallout. The strategic agent says "we walk."

The market has shifted from speed to strategy. Clients aren't paying 6% for quick responses—they're paying for judgment that protects their biggest investment. The agents winning now are the ones clients call before they call their lawyer.

What's one detail you wish your agent had caught before you closed on a property?

The real estate game has fundamentally changed. Speed used to be everything—first to respond, fastest to close. But the top producers aren't playing that game anymore.

Carrie McCormick, a top 1% Chicago producer with two decades of experience, recently walked her buyer away from what looked like a perfect deal. Full-price offer accepted, clean inspection, pre-approved financing. Every "fast" agent would have pushed to close.

Instead, she dug into the building's board minutes and discovered $40K in pending special assessments. That extra hour of due diligence saved her client a massive financial hit. This is the difference between being an order-taker and being an advisor.

The market has shifted from rewarding speed to rewarding strategy. Clients aren't paying premium commissions for quick text responses—they're paying for judgment that protects their largest investment. The agents thriving now are the ones clients call before they call their attorney.

In your experience, what separates truly strategic professionals from those who just work fast?
