### FACEBOOK

Your "about me" video got 47 views and zero calls. Meanwhile, top producers are booking listing appointments directly from theirs. What's the difference?

Former TV producer Kim Rittberg breaks it down: Stop bragging about your Rookie of the Year award. Start talking about the family you helped buy their first home for $30,000 under asking. Stop mentioning your million-dollar club plaque. Start sharing how you got a seller an extra week to move so they didn't need storage.

Nobody hires you because you won an award. They hire you because they believe you can solve their problem. The fastest way to prove that? Show them you already did it for someone exactly like them.

What's the most memorable client win you've had this year? Something that would make a prospect think "I need this agent on my team."

Stop listing awards. Start sharing client wins.

The family you saved $30K under asking. The seller you gave extra time to move. The couple you guided through a bidding war without losing their minds.

Your "about me" video isn't generating leads because you're highlighting the wrong accomplishments.

Most real estate professionals lead with awards, designations, and years of experience. But prospects scroll past these industry accolades without engaging. Former TV producer Kim Rittberg, who's coached hundreds of agents, reveals the missing piece.

The most effective "about me" videos don't showcase plaques—they showcase client outcomes. The family you helped secure their first home $30,000 under asking price. The seller you negotiated an extra week for, saving them storage costs and stress. The buyers you guided through multiple offers without them losing confidence.

Here's the truth: Nobody hires you because you won Rookie of the Year. They hire you because they believe you can solve their specific problem. The fastest way to build that confidence? Demonstrate you've already delivered results for someone in their exact situation.

Before your next video, document three specific client wins with measurable outcomes. That's your script—not your resume.

What client success story would resonate most with your ideal prospects?
