Your top agent didn't quit because of commission splits. They quit because three weeks ago, you got defensive when they questioned your pricing strategy in front of the whole team. You won the argument, but you lost the relationship.

Performance coach Paul Salter reveals the real pattern that's bleeding talent from real estate teams: leaders who can't regulate their emotions when challenged. That tightness in your chest when someone questions your authority? It's not weakness—it's information asking for attention.

The fix is surprisingly simple: a 90-second technique before every team meeting. Notice the feeling, name it silently ("I feel threatened"), take three breaths, then ask "What if they're right?" That pause between feeling and reacting is where you keep your top performers.

What's the most challenging feedback you've received from your team lately, and how did you respond?

Your best agent didn't quit over money—they quit because you couldn't handle their feedback without getting defensive.

Performance coach Paul Salter breaks down the real reason top talent leaves: that moment when you feel challenged, your chest tightens, and you bulldoze forward to "win" the argument. You won. You also lost the relationship.

The solution? A 90-second regulation technique before every team meeting: Notice the tightness. Name it ("I feel threatened"). Breathe three times. Ask "What if they're right?" That pause between feeling and reacting is where you keep your A-players.

Your highest-performing agent just handed in their resignation. Not because of commission splits or better opportunities elsewhere. They quit because three weeks ago, when they questioned your pricing strategy in a team meeting, you got defensive and shut them down in front of everyone.

This scenario plays out in real estate offices every day. Performance coach Paul Salter identifies the pattern: we feel our authority challenged, experience physical tension, then bulldoze forward with data to prove we're right. We win the argument. We lose the relationship—and often, the agent.

The solution isn't suppressing these feelings. It's learning to regulate them. Salter teaches a 90-second technique: Notice the tightness in your chest. Name it silently ("I feel threatened"). Take three conscious breaths. Then ask one powerful question: "What if they're right?"

That pause between feeling challenged and reacting defensively—that's where exceptional leaders operate. It's where you transform potential conflict into collaborative problem-solving. It's where you keep your top talent.

How do you handle pushback from your team when you feel your expertise is being questioned?
