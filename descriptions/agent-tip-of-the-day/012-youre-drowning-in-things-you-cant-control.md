$2 billion in sales. Started at $12/hour at Home Depot. Chase Craig cracked the code that most agents never figure out.

While everyone's freaking out about interest rates and market conditions, Chase built his empire focusing on just three things: his database (birthday texts to every past client), his response time (under 5 minutes, period), and his daily actions (5 prospecting calls before email). That's it.

The rest? Pure noise. He ignores what Zillow's doing, what competitors post, even inventory numbers. When you're spiraling about things outside your control, you're stealing time from the only activities that actually get you paid.

What's the one thing you can control today that you've been avoiding?

Chase Craig went from $12/hour at Home Depot to $2 billion in real estate sales. His secret wasn't market timing or fancy tech—it was radical focus.

While most agents get paralyzed by interest rate fluctuations, inventory shortages, and competitor activity, Chase identified three controllable variables: database management (birthday texts to every past client), response velocity (sub-5-minute lead callbacks), and consistent daily prospecting (5 calls before checking email).

The insight that changed everything: "There's so many things we deal with as real estate professionals, and it's easy to get caught up in the muck." He systematically ignores market noise that doesn't directly impact his three core activities.

This isn't about working harder—it's about channeling energy into variables you actually control. Most agents waste cognitive bandwidth on external factors while neglecting the fundamentals that drive revenue.

In your business, what would happen if you identified your own "big three" controllables and ignored everything else?
