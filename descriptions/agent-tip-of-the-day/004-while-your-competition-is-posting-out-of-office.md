Five focused weeks in December equals three months of catching up later. That's not motivation - that's math.

While your competition posts "Out of Office" and checks out early, mindset coach Paul Salter calls this "Separation Season." It's your chance to lap not just other agents, but the version of yourself from last year.

The agent who closes three deals in December isn't just ahead on commission. They're walking into January with unstoppable momentum while everyone else manufactures energy from scratch.

Here's the move: Text three past clients right now: "Hey [name], thinking of you this season. Coffee on me this week?" 

What's your separation season strategy? How are you using December while others coast?

While most agents are winding down for the year, there's a different conversation happening among top producers.

Mindset coach Paul Salter calls December "Separation Season" - and the math is compelling. Five focused weeks of consistent action now equals three months of catching up later for those who coast.

This isn't about grinding harder. It's about strategic separation. The agent who closes three deals in December doesn't just earn extra commission - they enter January with momentum that others have to manufacture from scratch.

Consider this simple move: Text three past clients today with "Hey [name], thinking of you this season. Coffee on me this week?" While competitors post out-of-office messages, you're deepening relationships.

What's your approach to December? Are you coasting with the crowd or creating separation?
