Inventory dropped 40% in one Chicago zip code, but that's not why Carrie McCormick won a $2.1M listing over her competition.

When the buyer asked why the house was priced at $2.1M, the other agent said "market analysis supports it." Carrie said: "Two comps closed 90 days ago at $1.95M. Since then, inventory dropped 40% in this zip code. We priced at $2.1M because we're launching with a 72-hour social blitz, broker event Tuesday, and if we don't get action in 10 days, we adjust. Here's the timeline."

One agent gave a number. One gave certainty. Guess who got the listing?

As this top 1% Chicago luxury producer puts it: "Buyers don't reject homes. They reject uncertainty." The next time a buyer ghosts after a showing, it's not the house - it's that you gave them a price without a plan.

What's your go-to strategy for turning pricing conversations into certainty for your clients?

"Buyers don't reject homes. They reject uncertainty."

This insight from Carrie McCormick, a top 1% producer in Chicago's luxury market, perfectly captures why so many deals fall apart - and it has nothing to do with the property itself.

Here's a real example: Carrie was competing for a $2.1M listing. When the seller asked about pricing strategy, her competitor said "market analysis supports it." Carrie's response? "Two comps closed 90 days ago at $1.95M. Since then, inventory dropped 40% in this zip code. We priced at $2.1M because we're launching with a 72-hour social blitz, broker event Tuesday, and if we don't get action in 10 days, we adjust. Here's the timeline."

One agent gave a number. One gave certainty and a complete plan.

The difference isn't market knowledge - it's communication strategy. When clients ghost after presentations, it's rarely about your pricing. It's about the confidence and clarity you provide around that pricing.

In your next listing presentation, can you articulate not just the 'what' but the 'why now' and 'what if' scenarios?
