Zillow analyzed millions of listings and found something wild: homes with white bedding get 30% more engagement than identical homes with colorful linens. Not better homes. Just whiter sheets.

Amanda Pendleton from Zillow breaks down the psychology: white linens make rooms look bigger, cleaner, and more aspirational. Buyers scroll slower, click save, and book showings.

Her advice? Keep a $10 white duvet in your trunk. Five minutes before photos, swap out the floral comforter for crisp white. It's staging 101, but almost nobody's doing it.

You're already telling sellers to clear counters and hide family photos. This is the same principle — except you get the competitive advantage right now.

What's the simplest staging hack that's made the biggest difference in your listings?

Here's a fascinating insight from Zillow's data team: after analyzing millions of listings, they discovered that homes photographed with white bedding receive 30% more engagement than identical properties with colorful linens.

Amanda Pendleton, who works directly with this data at Zillow, shared something that stopped me in my tracks. Her advice to agents? "Keep a white duvet in your trunk."

Think about it: for $10 and five minutes of effort before the photographer arrives, you can make bedrooms appear larger, cleaner, and more aspirational to buyers. It's the same staging principle we apply to clearing counters and removing personal photos, but hardly anyone is doing it yet.

The psychology is simple but powerful. White linens create a blank canvas that allows buyers to envision themselves in the space. They scroll slower through the photos, save the listing more often, and ultimately book more showings.

We're already coaching sellers on presentation details that matter. But this specific insight gives early adopters a clear competitive advantage while the majority of agents remain unaware of its impact.
