Gen Z buyers are making 50% more income than boomers were at their age — but they're not calling you back. Amanda Pendleton from Zillow dove into the actual data, and what she found should make every agent rethink their prospecting strategy this week.

Here's the reality: Gen Z isn't broke. They're researching properties on TikTok at 11pm, watching neighborhood tours on YouTube during lunch breaks, and asking ChatGPT about mortgage rates. They don't need another market report email — they need agents who answer DMs within an hour and create 30-second neighborhood walkthroughs showing the coffee shop three blocks away.

The numbers don't lie: Gen Z closed 30% more home purchases last year than the year before. They're just working with the handful of agents in each market who actually respond fast and communicate in their language. Every year they wait to buy costs them $30,000 in equity.

What's your strategy for connecting with Gen Z buyers in your market?

Gen Z makes 50% more than boomers did at their age. So why aren't you calling them back? 📱

Amanda Pendleton's Zillow data reveals the truth: Gen Z isn't broke — they're just buying differently. They're researching on TikTok at 11pm, watching neighborhood tours on YouTube, and DM'ing agents who actually respond fast.

Gen Z closed 30% more purchases last year. The question is: which agents got them? Spoiler alert — it's the ones answering DMs in under an hour and posting 30-second neighborhood walks showing the local coffee spots.

Amanda Pendleton from Zillow recently analyzed Gen Z home buying patterns, and the data reveals a critical blind spot in how most agents approach this demographic.

The headline finding: Gen Z is earning 50% more income than baby boomers were at the same age. Yet many agents still aren't prioritizing them as serious buyers. This disconnect is costing both agents and buyers significant opportunities.

Here's what's actually happening in the market: Gen Z buyers are conducting research at 11pm on TikTok, watching neighborhood tours during lunch breaks on YouTube, and turning to AI for mortgage rate information. They closed 30% more home purchases last year compared to the previous year — but they're gravitating toward the small percentage of agents who communicate on their preferred platforms and respond within an hour.

The financial stakes are real: every year a potential buyer delays their purchase costs them approximately $30,000 in equity. For agents, this represents a massive market opportunity that most are missing entirely.

The solution isn't complicated — it's about meeting buyers where they already spend their time and adapting communication styles to match their preferences.

How is your brokerage adapting its approach to serve the evolving expectations of Gen Z buyers?
