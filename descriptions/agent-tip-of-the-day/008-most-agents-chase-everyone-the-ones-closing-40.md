Most agents closing $40 million per year aren't working harder than you. They're working narrower. Way narrower.

Bari Mill cracked the code when she stopped chasing everyone and started showing up in ONE world: Chicago finance professionals. She joined their networking group, listened instead of pitching, and became THE agent they think of. One connection led to four referrals within months.

Here's the thing - you don't need a thousand leads. You need twenty people who trust you in one specific world. One group. One monthly meetup. One conversation that changes everything.

Tonight, Google "[your city] + [your industry] networking group" and RSVP to something happening this month. That's literally how this starts.

Not pitching. Just listening. One connection became four referrals.

The agents closing $40+ million annually aren't working 80-hour weeks. They're working strategically.

Bari Mill transformed her real estate career by making one counterintuitive move: instead of casting a wide net, she narrowed her focus to Chicago finance professionals.

She joined their networking group, showed up consistently, and resisted the urge to pitch. After three months of simply listening and building relationships, one connection asked about her real estate expertise. That single relationship generated four referrals within a year.

The insight? You don't need a thousand leads. You need twenty trusted relationships in one specific world. When people in that industry need real estate services, you become the obvious choice - not because you're everywhere, but because you're the only agent they consistently see in their professional sphere.

The execution is simple: Google "[your city] + [target industry] networking group" tonight. RSVP to an upcoming event. Show up. Listen. Build relationships first, business second.

What industry or professional group could you dominate in your market?
