Your buyer just asked if they could write a letter to the seller's dead mother. That's not fiction – that's a real story from a Seattle agent.

Marisa Kashino wrote a bestselling novel about house hunting madness, but here's the thing: every crazy plot point came from real agents sharing their wildest buyer stories. We're talking about clients who paid for sellers' divorce attorneys, named babies after sellers, and bought neighboring houses just to get closer.

When buyers get outbid eleven times, you're not managing transactions anymore. You're managing people at their absolute breaking point, watching the biggest investment of their lives slip away again and again.

The solution? One simple question in your next buyer consultation: "What's the craziest thing you've considered doing to get a house?" Their answer tells you exactly where to set boundaries before things get unhinged.

What's the wildest thing a buyer has done (or wanted to do) in one of your deals?

Your buyer just asked if they could write a letter to the seller's dead mother 💀

This isn't fiction. This actually happened to an agent in Seattle, and it inspired a bestselling novel about house hunting madness.

When buyers get outbid 11 times, you're not managing transactions anymore – you're managing people at their breaking point. They'll pay for divorce attorneys, name babies after sellers, or stalk owners at grocery stores.

The fix? Ask every buyer: "What's the craziest thing you've considered doing to get a house?" Their answer shows you exactly where to set boundaries.

A buyer once asked their agent if they could write a letter to the seller's dead mother.

That's not a made-up horror story – it's a real experience from a Seattle agent that helped inspire Marisa Kashino's bestselling novel about the madness of today's housing market.

Here's what Marisa discovered while researching her book: when buyers face their 11th rejection, rational decision-making goes out the window. Agents shared stories of clients offering to pay for sellers' divorce attorneys, promising to name babies after sellers, and even purchasing neighboring properties just to get closer to their dream home.

The business insight? You're not just managing real estate transactions. You're managing people at their absolute breaking point – individuals watching the largest investment of their lives slip away repeatedly. Without clear boundaries, that emotional volatility becomes your daily reality.

The solution is surprisingly simple: add one question to every buyer consultation: "What's the craziest thing you've considered doing to get a house?" Their response immediately shows you where boundaries need to be established before desperation takes over.

What's the most extreme thing you've seen a buyer do (or consider doing) to secure a property?
