Agents doing $50 million a year don't have difficult clients. They have something the rest of us are missing.

Kristee Leonard moves over $50 million in luxury Austin real estate annually, and her secret isn't better marketing or more leads. It's a complete mindset reframe about client relationships.

While most agents complain about 9 PM texts and multiple showings, Kristee sees them differently: "It's an honor to be chosen by clients, and I treat them like they're an honor." That 9 PM text? It's someone who trusted you with their biggest financial decision. That third showing request? It's someone making sure they get it right.

When you treat being chosen as a privilege instead of a burden, clients feel that energy. And that energy is what separates a one-time transaction from a referral machine.

What's the last text you sent a client - did it feel like serving someone you're honored to work with?

The highest-producing real estate agents have cracked a code the rest of us are missing.

Kristee Leonard moves over $50 million in luxury Austin real estate every year. When I asked about client management, her response stopped me cold: "It's an honor to be chosen by clients, and I treat them like they're an honor."

Most agents see late-night texts as interruptions and multiple showing requests as annoyances. Kristee reframes them as privileges - someone trusted you with their largest financial decision and wants to get it right.

This mindset shift changes everything. When clients feel honored instead of tolerated, they sense that energy. That energy difference is what separates transactional relationships from referral machines that build sustainable businesses.

The question isn't whether you provide good service - it's whether your clients feel like you consider serving them a privilege or a burden.

Look at your last three client interactions: Would someone receiving those communications feel honored to work with you?
