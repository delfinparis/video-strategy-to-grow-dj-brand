Michael Thornton does $30 million a year in real estate volume, and he says the biggest threat to your business isn't market conditions or competition. It's your emotional rollercoaster.

Here's what he means: You close a big deal and feel invincible, so you stop prospecting for two weeks. Or you lose a listing and spiral into doubt, avoiding calls because you're "not in the right headspace." Both responses absolutely destroy your pipeline.

Top producers treat wins and losses the same way - as data points, not identity markers. Monday morning looks identical whether they closed three deals Friday or lost a buyer to another agent. Your income isn't determined by your best month or worst month. It's determined by whether you can do the same core activities every single day, regardless of how you feel.

What's the one activity you always skip when you're riding high? And what do you avoid when things feel tough? That's where you're bleeding business.

Michael Thornton generates $30 million annually in real estate volume. According to him, the greatest threat to an agent's business isn't market volatility or increased competition—it's their own emotional inconsistency.

The pattern is predictable: close a significant deal, feel invincible, then ease off prospecting activities for weeks. Conversely, lose a listing or buyer, spiral into self-doubt, and avoid making calls because you're "not in the right headspace." Both responses systematically destroy your pipeline.

Elite producers have mastered something most agents struggle with: emotional regulation in business operations. They treat wins and losses as data points rather than identity markers. Whether they closed three transactions on Friday or lost a buyer to a competitor, Monday morning's activities remain identical.

Your annual income isn't determined by your peak month or your valley month. It's determined by your ability to execute the same core revenue-generating activities consistently, regardless of recent outcomes or current emotional state.

What's the one critical activity you consistently skip during high-confidence periods? And which one do you avoid when facing challenges?
