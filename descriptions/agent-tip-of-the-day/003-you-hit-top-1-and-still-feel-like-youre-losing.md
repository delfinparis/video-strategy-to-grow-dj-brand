Garrett Maroon hit 47 transactions and top 1% status. His reward? His daughter asking why he missed another recital.

So he did something most agents would call crazy: he fired 60% of his database. Just stopped chasing C and D clients entirely. Hired a $15/hour showing assistant and drew hard boundaries—no calls after 6pm, no Sunday showings.

His volume dropped to 32 deals the next year. But he coached every single one of his son's baseball games AND made more per transaction because he was only working with A clients who actually valued his time.

The breakthrough isn't doing more deals. It's getting crystal clear on what success actually means to YOU, then having the guts to cut everything that doesn't fit that vision.

What would you cut from your business if you knew it would give you back your evenings and weekends?

The top 1% real estate producer who fired 60% of his clients—and why it was the smartest business decision he ever made.

Garrett Maroon was crushing it by every industry metric. 47 transactions. Top 1% in Southeast Virginia. Awards on the shelf. But when his daughter asked why he missed another recital, he realized he was winning the wrong game entirely.

His radical solution: Fire 60% of his database overnight. Stop chasing C and D clients who drained his energy. Hire a showing assistant for $15/hour. Create hard boundaries—no calls after 6pm, no Sunday showings.

The result? Volume dropped to 32 deals, but profit per transaction increased significantly because he was exclusively working with A-level clients who valued his expertise and respected his time. More importantly, he didn't miss a single one of his son's baseball games that season.

Most professionals confuse being busy with being successful. But real success isn't about maximizing transactions—it's about optimizing for the life you actually want to live while building a sustainable, profitable business.

What would happen to your business if you fired your three most energy-draining clients tomorrow?
