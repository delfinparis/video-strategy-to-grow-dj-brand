REALTOR of the Year Connie Mahan went from restaurant management to top producer in Central Florida with one simple shift: she stopped preparing and started doing.

Her advice? "Get in and do, and the rest will figure itself out." Not take another course. Not shadow someone for six months. Just start. The agents who wait for perfect conditions are still waiting while the ones who started messy are closing deals.

Here's the truth: You're not behind because you don't know everything. You're behind because you're still studying instead of doing. The market rewards reps, not readiness.

Connie's challenge: Call one expired listing today. You'll fumble the script, sound nervous, and learn more in that five-minute call than in five hours of YouTube videos.

What's the one thing you keep putting off until you feel "ready enough"?

From restaurant management to REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida. Connie Mahan's secret wasn't another certification or course.

It was this: "Get in and do, and the rest will figure itself out."

While most new agents get stuck in perpetual preparation mode, Connie chose imperfect action. First listing? She messed up the photos. Panicked about contracts. Called for help. And learned more from that one deal than months of training could teach.

The pattern is clear: agents who wait for perfect conditions are still waiting. The ones who started messy are the ones closing deals today.

The market doesn't reward readiness—it rewards repetition. Every fumbled script, every nervous call, every imperfect listing becomes your real education.

What's the one action in your business that you keep postponing until you feel "ready enough"?
