Eithan Davidov closes 100+ deals a year in Queens, and he just revealed the one thing he absolutely hates about his job. It's not cold calling. It's not difficult negotiations. It's the follow-up.

"The fortune is in the follow-up," he told me. "Not the first call. Not the listing presentation. The third text. The fifth email. The call three months later when they're finally ready." That's where deals actually get made or lost.

Here's the kicker – even top producers hate doing it. But they do it anyway because they know the agents who can't stomach consistent follow-up are the same ones wondering why their pipeline is empty. They build systems so it happens whether they feel like it or not.

Your move: Open your CRM right now and find three people you should've followed up with last month. Send them something. That uncomfortable follow-up might just be worth six figures.

What's your biggest follow-up challenge? How do you stay consistent when it feels like you're bothering people?

The guy closing 100 deals a year just admitted what he hates most about his job (and it's not what you think) 🤯

Eithan Davidov doesn't hate cold calls or tough negotiations. He hates follow-up. But here's the thing – he does it anyway because "the fortune is in the follow-up."

Not the first call. Not the listing presentation. The third text. The fifth email. The call three months later when they're finally ready. That's where deals live or die.

If follow-up feels like pulling teeth, you're not broken – you're normal. The difference is top producers do it even when it sucks.

I sat down with Eithan Davidov, who runs one of the top real estate teams in Queens, closing 100+ transactions annually. When I asked what separates the closers from everyone else, his answer surprised me.

It wasn't prospecting skills or negotiation tactics. It was follow-up – specifically, the follow-up he absolutely hates doing but does anyway.

"The fortune is in the follow-up," Eithan explained. "Not the first call. Not the listing presentation. The third text. The fifth email. The call three months later when they're finally ready." That's the uncomfortable truth about where deals actually get made.

Here's what struck me most: Even someone closing 100+ deals a year finds follow-up challenging. The difference isn't that top producers enjoy it more – they just build systems to ensure it happens consistently, regardless of how they feel about it.

If you're avoiding your CRM or follow-up feels like pulling teeth, you're not broken. You're normal. The question is: Will you build the systems to do it anyway?

What systems have you implemented to stay consistent with follow-up, even when it feels uncomfortable?
