Most agents think their job ends at closing. Karina Chavez learned the hard way during the 2008 crash that this mindset destroys families.

Now as a top 1% producer in Albuquerque, she prints every single loan document and walks clients through each page. Not because she has to, but because she watched too many people lose everything they thought they understood.

The payoff? Years later, when one of her clients faced a medical crisis, Karina could remind her: "This is what your house is for. This is what all the sacrifices have been for." That's the difference between selling a house and building generational wealth.

Can your clients explain their mortgage well enough to teach their own kids?

After watching the 2008 crash devastate her Albuquerque community, top 1% producer Karina Chavez completely changed how she serves clients.

She now prints every loan document and walks through each page with buyers. Not because she's required to, but because she learned that most people don't truly understand what they've purchased until it's too late.

The result? When one of her clients faced a medical crisis years later, Karina could remind her that her home equity was exactly the safety net she'd worked so hard to build.

This is the difference between completing transactions and building relationships that span decades. We're not just selling properties—we're selling financial security and peace of mind.

How are you ensuring your clients truly understand the long-term value of their investment?
