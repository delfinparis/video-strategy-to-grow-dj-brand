Most agents lose deals and have no idea why. They think the other side just "got cold feet" or "went with someone else." But Tim Burrell, a top producer in Raleigh, discovered the real reason: we're terrible at reading digital tone.

Here's his game-changer: He runs every negotiation email through ChatGPT with a custom prompt that detects frustration levels on a 1-10 scale. When it flags a 6 or higher, he picks up the phone instead of typing back. The AI catches tone shifts that kill deals before they happen.

Think about your last deal that died unexpectedly. You probably sent 2-3 emails that week that landed wrong, but you didn't know it until it was too late. This catches email number one.

What's the last deal you lost that made you think "I should have seen that coming"?

We're losing deals in the digital gaps between what we mean and what our clients hear.

Tim Burrell, a top producer in Raleigh, identified this blind spot and built a solution around it. He uses ChatGPT to analyze the emotional temperature of every negotiation email thread, rating frustration levels on a 1-10 scale.

When the AI flags anything above a 6, he switches from email to phone. The result? He catches relationship deterioration before it kills the transaction. Most agents realize there's a problem only after the deal dies, then wonder what they missed.

The insight here isn't just about AI—it's about recognizing that negotiation success often depends on micro-signals we're not trained to catch. Email strips away vocal tone and body language, leaving us to guess at emotional states. That's a dangerous game when six-figure commissions are on the line.

Your last deal that fell apart unexpectedly—what communication red flags do you wish you'd caught earlier?
