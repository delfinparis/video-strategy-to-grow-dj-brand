Agents closing $2B+ in luxury deals have one habit most agents skip entirely. After every single conversation — showings, negotiations, client calls — they send one simple email.

Not a novel. Just three bullets: what we discussed, what we agreed on, next step. Takes 30 seconds to write. But here's why it's genius: it eliminates those "I thought you said" arguments that kill deals. It keeps YOU controlling the narrative instead of your client rewriting history.

Jill Preschel learned this sitting across from private equity partners who'd conveniently "forget" what they agreed to in meetings. The email isn't rude — it's a receipt.

Most agents think the hard part is having the conversation. Wrong. The hard part is making sure it sticks.

What's your go-to move for keeping clients accountable to what they actually said?

I just learned why agents closing $2B+ in luxury transactions never have "I thought you said" arguments with clients. And it's brilliantly simple.

Jill Preschel, who works with private equity partners and institutional investors in NYC luxury markets, shared her non-negotiable habit: After every single conversation — client calls, showings, negotiations — she sends one follow-up email.

Not a dissertation. Just three bullets: "Here's what we discussed. Here's what we agreed on. Here's the next step." Takes 30 seconds to write.

She learned this the hard way sitting across from capital partners who'd conveniently "forget" meeting agreements. The email isn't confrontational — it's documentation. A professional receipt.

The result? She controls the narrative. Eliminates confusion. And positions herself as the consummate professional while competitors wing it and hope for the best.

Most agents think closing the conversation is the hard part. The real skill is making sure it sticks.

How do you ensure client conversations translate into consistent follow-through?
