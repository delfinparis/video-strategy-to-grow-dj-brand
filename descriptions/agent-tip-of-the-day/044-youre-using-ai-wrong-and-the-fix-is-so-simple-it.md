A $30 million per year real estate agent just shared the simplest AI hack I've ever heard. While most agents are asking ChatGPT to write listing descriptions, Michael Thornton is asking it something completely different.

He literally asks AI: "How can I use you better for real estate?" And then he actually reads the response. The AI suggests workflows he never knew existed, prompts he never thought to try. It's like having AI train him instead of just doing tasks for him.

The result? His content now shows up as source material when people ask AI about his local market. He's not just using the algorithm – he's learning directly from it how to beat it.

This approach has helped him build a business that does $30M annually in Wheaton, Illinois. Instead of treating AI like a tool, he treats it like a personal coach that gets smarter every time he asks better questions.

What's the first AI question you're going to ask after watching this?

Most real estate professionals are using AI backward.

Michael Thornton, who produces $30 million annually in Wheaton, Illinois, discovered something fascinating: instead of just asking ChatGPT to complete tasks, he asks it to teach him how to use it better for real estate.

The conversation is simple: "How can I use you better for my real estate business?" The AI responds with workflows, prompts, and strategies he never considered. It's like having a personal AI coach that evolves with his business needs.

The compound effect is remarkable. His content now appears as source material when prospects search AI about his local market. He's not just leveraging technology – he's learning from it how to stay ahead of it.

This mindset shift from "AI as tool" to "AI as coach" represents a fundamental change in how top producers approach technology. They don't just use it; they let it shape their expertise.

What would happen if you asked your business tools to teach you how to use them more effectively?
