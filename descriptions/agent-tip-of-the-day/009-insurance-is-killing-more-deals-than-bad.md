A $2 million home now costs $25K a year just to insure. That's a $2,000 monthly payment your buyer didn't budget for – and it's killing more deals than bad inspections.

Jeff Biebuyck, a top 1% agent in Calabasas and Hidden Hills, is watching it happen in real time. Buyers get pre-approved, inspections come back clean, then the insurance quote arrives and the whole deal falls apart. In fire-risk zones, premiums doubled or tripled. In flood zones, policies disappeared entirely.

The game has changed. You can't just be a real estate agent anymore – you need to know insurance like you know comps. You need carriers who'll actually write policies, and you need to set expectations before the offer, not after.

Here's your homework: Call three insurance brokers this week and ask what's actually insurable in your market right now. Because if you're not having this conversation before escrow, your competition is.

What's the craziest insurance situation you've dealt with lately?

The solution? Know insurance like you know comps. Build relationships with carriers who actually write policies. Have the conversation before the offer, not after escrow.

Insurance has become the silent deal killer that most agents aren't prepared for.

I recently spoke with Jeff Biebuyck, a top 1% agent working luxury properties in Calabasas and Hidden Hills, about a troubling trend: buyers walking away from deals not because of inspections or appraisals, but because of insurance quotes they never saw coming.

The numbers are staggering. A $2 million property now costs $25,000 annually to insure in high-risk areas – that's an additional $2,000 monthly payment that wasn't factored into pre-approval calculations. In fire-risk zones, premiums have doubled or tripled. In flood zones, some policies have disappeared entirely.

This shift demands a fundamental change in how we serve clients. We can no longer operate solely as real estate professionals – we need to understand insurance markets as well as we understand comparable sales. We need relationships with carriers who actually write policies, not just quote them.

The most successful agents are now having insurance conversations before offers are submitted, not during escrow when it's too late to pivot.

How are you adapting your client consultation process to address insurability before it becomes a deal-breaker?
