That client comment that ruined your whole day? It hit because you already believed it deep down.

Paul Salter, a mindset coach who works with high performers, just dropped truth that nobody wants to hear: "When something someone says triggers you, it's a mirror of a part of yourself you don't like." The feedback about your response time? You already know you're dropping balls. The comment about follow-through? You're already ashamed of those deals that fell apart.

The defensiveness isn't protecting you—it's keeping you stuck. The trigger is actually showing you exactly where the real work needs to happen.

What criticism about your business have you been fighting the hardest? That's probably your biggest opportunity for growth.

The criticism about your response time? You know you're dropping balls. The comment about follow-through? You're already ashamed of deals that fell apart.

That client comment that ruined your entire day? Here's why it stung so much—you already believed it.

Paul Salter, who coaches high-performing professionals through defensiveness patterns, shared an uncomfortable truth: "When something someone says triggers you, it's a mirror of a part of yourself you don't like." 

Think about the last piece of feedback that really got under your skin. The client who commented on your response time? Deep down, you know you've been dropping the ball on communication. The one who questioned your follow-through? You're already carrying shame about deals that fell apart.

Our defensiveness isn't protecting us—it's keeping us stuck. Because we can't improve what we refuse to acknowledge. The trigger is actually diagnostic, showing us exactly where our attention and energy need to go.

What criticism about your business practices have you been fighting the hardest? That resistance might be pointing you toward your next breakthrough.
