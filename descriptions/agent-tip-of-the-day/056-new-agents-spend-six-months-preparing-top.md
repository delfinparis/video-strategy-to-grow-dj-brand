New real estate agents spend an average of 6 months "preparing" while top producers spend 6 days doing. That's the reality check D.J. Paris and REALTOR of the Year Connie Mahan want you to hear.

You're waiting for the perfect script, perfect market, perfect confidence. Meanwhile, someone who got licensed last week just closed their first deal. The difference? They stopped studying and started doing.

Connie's breakthrough came when she was told: "Get in and do. The rest will figure itself out." Not study more. Not wait until comfortable. DO. Door-knocking taught her objection handling better than any course. Open houses taught her buyer psychology. The doing created the knowing.

Your first ten conversations will be terrible - and that's the point. You're not unprepared, you're untested. There's a difference.

What's one scary action you could take today instead of watching another training video?

Here's an uncomfortable truth: New real estate agents spend an average of 6 months "preparing" while top producers spend 6 days executing.

I recently spoke with Connie Mahan, REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida, about what separates successful agents from those who struggle. Her breakthrough moment came with this advice: "Get in and do. The rest will figure itself out."

Not "study more courses." Not "wait until you feel ready." Just DO.

Connie learned objection handling through door-knocking, buyer psychology through open houses, and confidence through expired listings. The market became her classroom, and action became her curriculum.

The reality? Your first ten client conversations will likely be terrible. But here's the reframe: you're not unprepared—you're untested. There's a crucial difference between knowledge and experience.

What's one action you could take today that would teach you more than any course or webinar?
