When a seller Googles three agents, two have bios. One has a video. Guess who gets the call?

Kim Rittberg, former TV producer turned agent coach, says the one video that changes everything isn't what you think. It's not your listing tours or market updates. It's your About Me video - the one that shows your personality, proves your worth, and answers why YOU are the call they should make.

Here's the game changer: Before the consult even happens, they've already heard your voice and decided they like you. You walk in warm, not cold. You're not pitching anymore - you're confirming what they already believe.

Tonight's homework: Record 3 minutes on your phone. Who you are, why you do this, one story that proves it. Upload to YouTube tomorrow with your name in the title.

What's stopping most agents from making this simple video?

You're invisible on Google. And that's why you're losing listings to agents with half your experience. 👀

When sellers Google you and find just text while your competitor has video, the choice is already made. Kim Rittberg says your About Me video isn't optional anymore.

The shift? They hear your voice BEFORE the appointment. You walk into listings as the agent they already chose, not the one still pitching.

The listing went to the agent they could see. Not the one with the best resume.

Kim Rittberg, who spent 20 years in TV production before coaching real estate professionals, identified a critical gap: most agents are completely invisible where it matters most. When potential clients Google your name, what do they find?

Her insight challenges conventional wisdom. It's not your market updates or listing tours that convert strangers into clients. It's your About Me video - the content that shows personality, demonstrates expertise, and answers the fundamental question: "What makes you different?"

The competitive advantage is profound. While other agents rely on text-based bios and credentials, video creates connection before the first meeting. Prospects arrive at consultations having already heard your voice and formed a positive impression. You're no longer selling yourself; you're confirming their existing belief.

The implementation is surprisingly simple: record three minutes explaining who you are, why you chose real estate, and one story that proves your value. Upload it to YouTube with your name in the title for maximum searchability.

What's preventing most professionals from creating this fundamental piece of marketing collateral?
