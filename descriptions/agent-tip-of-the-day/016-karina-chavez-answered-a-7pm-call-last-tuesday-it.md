She answered her phone at 7pm on a Tuesday. By Thursday, she had a $480,000 listing. Most agents would've let that call go to voicemail.

Karina Chavez, a top 1% producer in Albuquerque, built her entire business on one simple rule that most agents completely ignore: always answer your phone. That Tuesday evening call was from a past client's coworker whose original agent had gone MIA during inspection. She needed someone who'd actually pick up.

Here's the reality check: people don't want to leave voicemails about six-figure decisions. They want a human. Right now. And they'll move to the next agent in their contacts faster than you think.

If you're stuck at 30 deals wondering why you can't break through, check how many calls you sent to voicemail last week. One of those could've been your easiest $15,000 commission of the year.

What's the biggest deal that came from answering an unexpected call?

A 7pm phone call on Tuesday became a $480,000 listing by Thursday. The difference? Karina Chavez actually answered.

As a top 1% producer in Albuquerque who built her business entirely on referrals, Karina follows one non-negotiable rule that most agents overlook: always answer your phone. That Tuesday evening call was from a past client's coworker whose original agent had disappeared during inspection.

Here's the business reality: people don't want to leave voicemails about six-figure decisions. They want immediate human connection and will move to the next agent in their contacts within minutes, not hours.

If you're plateaued at your current production level, audit your missed calls from last week. How many went to voicemail because you were "busy"? Each unanswered call represents potential lost revenue—one could've been worth $15,000+ in commission.

The most successful agents understand that availability isn't just customer service—it's competitive advantage. When everyone else is screening calls, being the agent who picks up sets you apart instantly.

What's the most valuable opportunity that came from answering an unexpected call in your business?
