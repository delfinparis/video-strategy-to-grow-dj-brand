Alabama requires 60 hours to get a real estate license. You know what requires more training time? Becoming a licensed barber. Yet these agents are handling someone's $400,000 life decision.

Real estate tech analyst Chris Linsell just said what veteran agents are thinking: the barrier to entry needs to be higher. While some states require 180 hours, others barely scratch 60-75 hours of training before handing out licenses.

The NAR's biggest opportunity isn't member perks or marketing campaigns. It's partnering with state regulators to raise licensing standards BEFORE agents enter the market, not just enforce ethics after they mess up.

If you've watched part-timers ghost clients mid-transaction while your reputation suffers by association, this isn't controversial—it's overdue.

What do you think? Should it be harder to get licensed as a real estate agent?

Real estate requires less training than becoming a barber in most states. Let that sink in. 💭

Chris Linsell dropped some hard truths: Alabama = 60 hours for real estate license. Barbers need MORE training time than that. These agents are handling $400K life decisions with less prep than someone cutting hair.

The solution? NAR should partner with states to raise the bar BEFORE agents get licensed, not just police them after they screw up.

A real estate tech analyst just said what veteran agents have been thinking for years: it should be harder to become a licensed real estate professional.

The numbers are staggering. Alabama requires 60 hours of training for a real estate license. Georgia requires 75 hours. Compare that to the 1,500+ hours required to become a licensed barber in most states. We're talking about professionals who handle someone's largest financial decision versus someone who cuts hair.

Chris Linsell's argument is compelling: instead of focusing solely on member perks and post-violation enforcement, NAR should partner with state regulators to raise licensing standards at the entry point. Higher barriers to entry could elevate the entire profession's reputation and competence.

If you've been in real estate long enough, you've watched part-time agents disappear mid-transaction, leaving clients stranded and tarnishing the reputation of serious professionals by association. The industry doesn't earn respect until it demands competence from day one.

Should the real estate industry require more rigorous training and higher licensing standards?
