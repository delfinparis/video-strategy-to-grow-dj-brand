Most agents quit making videos after attempt number three. But here's what Netflix marketer Kim Rittberg discovered: your tenth messy video will outperform someone else's polished first one every single time.

She tracked one agent's journey from "Um, so... homes are selling fast" (cringe-worthy video one) to confidently explaining why that new traffic pattern on Maple Street actually creates opportunity three blocks over (authoritative video twelve). Same person. Twelve reps. The magic happened in the mindset shift.

Video one thinking: "I should do this." Video twelve thinking: "I'm the only agent who's going to explain this." That transformation from obligation to authority changes everything.

Stop telling yourself you're "not a video person." You're just starting from the wrong place. Don't start with "should" – start with "only I know this about my market."

What's one thing most agents in your area don't tell buyers that you think they should know?

Your 10th messy video beats their polished 1st one. Here's why most agents never make it to video 10 👇

Netflix marketer Kim Rittberg studied agents who tried video and quit at attempt 3. She found the magic happens in the mindset shift.

Video 1 thinking: "I should do this" 
Video 12 thinking: "I'm ONLY agent explaining this"

That's the difference between obligation and authority. Stop saying you're "not a video person" – you're just starting wrong.

Most real estate professionals abandon video content after their third attempt. But data from Netflix marketer Kim Rittberg reveals a crucial insight: your tenth imperfect video will consistently outperform a competitor's polished debut.

She documented one agent's progression from generic "homes are selling fast" messaging to confidently explaining how a new traffic pattern creates hidden opportunities in adjacent neighborhoods. The transformation wasn't about production value—it was about mindset evolution.

The shift happens between video one ("I should do this") and video twelve ("I'm the only agent explaining this specific insight"). That's the difference between content created from obligation versus authority.

Many agents incorrectly assume they're "not video people" when they're actually just starting from the wrong foundation. Instead of beginning with "should," start with your unique market knowledge.

What specific insight about your local market do you possess that most agents overlook or fail to communicate to their clients?
