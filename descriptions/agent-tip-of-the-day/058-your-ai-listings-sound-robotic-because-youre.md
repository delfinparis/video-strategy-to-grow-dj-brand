Most real estate agents are getting terrible AI-generated listings because they're doing one thing wrong: writing prompts that are way too short.

D.J. Paris, who recruits top Chicago agents and builds AI tools for real estate, says the difference between robotic and compelling AI content isn't the tool - it's your input. When you just tell ChatGPT "rewrite this listing," you get generic garbage with phrases like "charming" and "don't miss out." But when you write a 7-8 sentence prompt that includes your voice, target buyer, the home's unique story, what to emphasize and avoid? That's when AI becomes your secret weapon.

The agents getting incredible results aren't using better AI tools. They're writing prompts longer than the actual listing description. They're having a conversation with AI, not barking commands at it.

What's the longest prompt you've ever written for AI content? Are you giving it enough context to sound like YOU?

Your AI listings sound robotic because you're writing 1 sentence when you need 7 sentences 🤖

D.J. Paris recruits top Chicago agents and builds AI tools - he says most realtors sabotage their own results without knowing it.

The difference? Stop commanding AI and start having a conversation. Tell it your voice, your buyer, the home's story, what to emphasize, what to skip. The agents crushing it with AI? Their prompts are longer than the listings themselves.

Here's why your AI-generated listings sound identical to every other agent's: you're not giving the technology enough context to work with.

D.J. Paris, VP of Business Development at Kale Realty and host of a 700+ episode real estate podcast, has identified a pattern among top-performing agents. The ones getting exceptional AI results aren't using different tools - they're using dramatically different inputs.

While most agents type "rewrite this listing" and wonder why they get generic content filled with overused phrases, successful agents write 7-8 sentence prompts. They're essentially having a strategic conversation with AI, providing context about their voice, target audience, the property's unique story, key selling points to emphasize, and clichés to avoid.

The irony? These agents often spend more time crafting their prompts than they used to spend writing listings from scratch. But the output is exponentially better and scales across their entire business.

Think about your current AI workflow: are you giving technology enough strategic direction to represent your brand authentically, or are you expecting it to read your mind?
