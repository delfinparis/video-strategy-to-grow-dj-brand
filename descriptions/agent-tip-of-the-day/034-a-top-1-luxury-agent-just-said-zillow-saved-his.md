A top 1% luxury agent in Calabasas just said something that'll make traditional real estate coaches cringe: "Zillow honestly saved our team."

Jeff Biebuyck was watching his hyper-local luxury market contract. While other agents doubled down on their precious zip codes, he did the exact opposite. He used Zillow Flex not as lead gen, but as a geographic expansion strategy to spread his team across ALL of Greater LA.

The result? While competitors waited for their micro-markets to recover, Jeff's team was closing deals in six different areas. It's not about the platform - it's about thinking like a business owner instead of a territory defender.

Your market doesn't owe you deals. Expansion isn't betrayal.

Are you defending territory or building a business? What's your take on using unexpected tools for market expansion?

When Jeff Biebuyck's luxury market in Calabasas started contracting, he faced the same choice every team leader confronts: double down or diversify.

Most agents chose to fight harder for fewer deals in their precious zip codes. Jeff took a different approach. He leveraged Zillow Flex not as a lead generation tool, but as a geographic expansion strategy to position his team across Greater Los Angeles.

The insight here isn't about the platform—it's about the mindset shift from territory defender to business owner. While competitors waited for their micro-markets to recover, Jeff's team was actively closing transactions in six different areas.

His exact words: "Zillow honestly saved our team... we were able to diversify and spread out across all of Greater Los Angeles."

This is what happens when you stop being precious about your territory and start thinking strategically about market positioning. Your local market doesn't owe you deals. Sometimes survival requires expansion, not entrenchment.

When your market contracts, do you defend your territory or expand your business model? What's been your experience with geographic diversification?
