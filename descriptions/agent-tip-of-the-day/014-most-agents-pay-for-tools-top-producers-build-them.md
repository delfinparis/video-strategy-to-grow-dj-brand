Most real estate agents spend $300+ per month on software subscriptions. D.J. Paris built a custom mortgage calculator in 47 minutes using ChatGPT and zero coding experience.

Here's the crazy part: AI will literally write functional code for you in 90 seconds. Mortgage calculator? Done. Neighborhood comparison tool? Done. School district generator? Done. You own it, control it, brand it - no bleeding monthly fees.

The prompt is simple: "Build me an HTML mortgage calculator that shows monthly payment, required income, and down payment scenarios." Copy the code, paste it into a free Carrd page, add your logo. Your clients will think you hired a developer.

The barrier between "I wish I had that tool" and "I built that tool" just collapsed. Every agent should be doing this.

What's the first custom tool you'd build for your business?

Most real estate professionals are paying hundreds per month for software tools they could build themselves in under an hour.

D.J. Paris, VP of Business Development at Kale Realty, proved this when he created a custom mortgage affordability calculator for his agents in just 47 minutes - with zero coding experience.

His approach was brilliant in its simplicity: He asked ChatGPT to build an HTML mortgage calculator, copied the generated code, and pasted it into a free Carrd page. Fifteen minutes of branding tweaks later, his agents had a professional tool that made them look like industry wizards to their buyers.

This isn't about becoming a developer. It's about recognizing that AI has eliminated the barrier between "I wish this tool existed" and "I built this tool." Mortgage calculators, neighborhood comparison tools, school district generators - all possible with a simple prompt and some copy-paste work.

The monthly subscription model is bleeding agents dry while the solution sits free in their browser. Every pain point your clients face could be solved with a custom tool you own and control.

What's the first tool you'd build to differentiate your real estate business?
