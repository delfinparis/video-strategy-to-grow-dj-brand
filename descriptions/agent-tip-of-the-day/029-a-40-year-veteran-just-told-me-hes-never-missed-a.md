40 years in luxury real estate. Never missed a single closing. When I asked Jay Cannone what separates agents who build empires from those who flame out, he didn't give me a marketing strategy or lead generation tip.

He told me about the Friday at 4pm when his buyer backed out. The seller was furious. Most agents would've hidden until Monday, crafted the perfect explanation, maybe sent a carefully worded email.

Instead, Jay drove to their house that same night. Sat at their kitchen table. No spin, no excuses - just the truth about what happened and exactly what he'd do next.

"Show up. Do the work. Be straight," he said. "Do that long enough, and success becomes inevitable."

What's the conversation you've been avoiding with a client? The uncomfortable truth you need to deliver?

In 40 years of luxury real estate in Fairfield County, Jay Cannone has never missed a closing. When I asked him what separates agents who build lasting careers from those who burn out, his answer surprised me.

It wasn't about lead generation, social media strategy, or market knowledge. It was about a Friday afternoon when his buyer backed out at 4pm.

The seller was furious. Most agents would have waited until Monday to craft the perfect explanation. Jay drove to their house that night, sat at their kitchen table, and told them exactly what happened - no spin, no excuses.

"Show up. Do the work. Be straight," he said. "Do that long enough, and success becomes inevitable."

In an industry full of shortcuts and polished presentations, consistently showing up when it's uncomfortable has become Jay's competitive advantage. The market eventually runs out of ways to say no to someone who keeps delivering truth, even when it's hard.

What uncomfortable conversation with a client are you currently avoiding?
