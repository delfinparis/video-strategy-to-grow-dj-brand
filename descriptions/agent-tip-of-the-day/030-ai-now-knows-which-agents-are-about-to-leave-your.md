AI can now predict which agents are about to leave your brokerage before you even suspect it. DJ Paris, who's recruited over 2,000 agents in 15 years, says this tool called Corded changed everything about how he builds teams.

Here's what blew my mind: it doesn't just identify flight-risk agents—it reads your brokerage website, learns what you offer, then writes personalized recruitment emails for each target agent. DJ says "Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer."

Think about the competitive advantage here. While most brokers are cold-calling random agents or posting generic "join us" content, smart recruiters are getting AI-generated lists of agents ready to move WITH the exact pitch to close them.

After 15 years and 2,000+ agent recruits, DJ Paris thought he'd seen every recruitment strategy. Then he discovered AI that predicts which agents are flight risks before brokers even know they're unhappy.

The tool, called Corded, analyzes production trends, social signals, and career patterns across entire markets. But here's the breakthrough: it doesn't just identify potential recruits—it reads your brokerage's value proposition and generates personalized outreach for each target agent.

"Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes the emails," Paris explains. While most brokers rely on generic recruitment tactics, this creates truly personalized approaches at scale.

The competitive implications are staggering. Imagine having a list of agents ready to move, complete with customized pitches that speak directly to their motivations and pain points.
