Your college roommate just bought a house. They didn't call you.

That gut punch? Every real estate agent knows it intimately. But here's what separates the agents who burn out from the ones who build $40 million businesses: They stop counting rejections and start counting opportunities.

Bari Mill, a top Chicago producer, learned this lesson the hard way. Instead of obsessing over the 3 people who ghosted her, she doubled down on the 30 who were still watching. Every hour spent spiraling about rejection is an hour not spent calling people who actually want to hear from you.

The agents who win? They grieve for 5 minutes, then get back on the phone.

What's one referral or client win you're grateful for this week?

Stop counting rejections. Start counting opportunities 💡

Your college roommate just bought a house. They didn't call you. That knot in your stomach? 

$40M producer Bari Mill felt it too. But here's what changed everything: focusing on the 30 people who MIGHT hire you instead of obsessing over the 3 who didn't.

Every hour you spend spiraling about rejection is an hour you're not calling people who actually want to hear from you. The agents who win grieve for 5 minutes, then get back on the phone.

Your college roommate just bought a house. They didn't call you.

That familiar sting of rejection hits every real estate professional at some point. But here's the mindset shift that separates struggling agents from top producers earning $40+ million annually.

Bari Mill, a leading Chicago agent, calls it "the breakup feeling" - when someone you've known for years chooses another agent. Her breakthrough came when her team lead said: "Focus on what you do have, not on what you don't."

Instead of obsessing over 3 lost opportunities, successful agents double down on the 30 potential clients who are watching to see if they quit or keep going. Every hour spent spiraling about rejection is an hour not invested in relationships that could actually convert.

The most successful agents grieve for 5 minutes, then get back on the phone. They understand that rejection often has nothing to do with their competence and everything to do with circumstances they'll never fully understand.

How do you bounce back from rejection in your business?
