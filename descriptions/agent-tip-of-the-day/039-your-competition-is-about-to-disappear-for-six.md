While most agents are planning their holiday break, top producers like Carrie McCormick ($300M Chicago producer) are gearing up for their biggest opportunity of the year. December isn't downtime — it's hunting season.

Here's her exact play: She filters her CRM for everyone who bought between 2020-2022. These homeowners now have equity, rates dropped to 6%, and they're finally willing to consider giving up those 3% mortgages. While competitors send generic holiday cards, she's making actual calls and booking January appointments.

The math is simple: What you do in Q4 determines your entire next year. January 1st, she wakes up with ten warm conversations already flowing. Her competition? They're starting from zero.

What's your December database strategy? Are you working your 2020-2022 buyer list or letting someone else capture that opportunity?

Every December, the real estate industry experiences the same phenomenon: mass hibernation. Agents coast into the holidays, pipeline activity drops, and prospecting stops.

Carrie McCormick sees this differently. As a $300 million producer in Chicago, she views Q4 as her competitive advantage window. While others send generic holiday cards, she's strategically working her database with laser focus.

Her approach is surgical: filter the CRM for 2020-2022 buyers. These homeowners now have significant equity, mortgage rates dropped to 6%, and they're finally psychologically ready to give up those 3% pandemic mortgages. She's making calls, booking January appointments, and building momentum while her competition watches football.

The business principle is clear: what you do in Q4 sets up your entire following year. January 1st arrives with either a loaded pipeline or the need to start from zero.

How are you positioning yourself for Q1 success while your market is quiet?
