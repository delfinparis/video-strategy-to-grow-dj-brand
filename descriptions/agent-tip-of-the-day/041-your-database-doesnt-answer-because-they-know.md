Chase Craig has closed $2 billion in sales across 6,000 transactions, and he says most agents have database calling completely backwards. They're asking for money instead of handing out gold bars.

Think about your last database call. Did you ask about their timeline? Pitch your services? That's asking for money. Gold bars are calling with exclusive market intel, off-market properties that fit their criteria, or neighborhood insights they can't get anywhere else.

When you become the person who gives gold bars first, your database starts picking up the phone. They want what you have instead of feeling guilty about ignoring you.

Before your next call, write down the gold bar you're giving. If you can't name it, find the gold first.

What's the best "gold bar" you've ever given your database that led to a deal?

Your database doesn't answer because they know you're calling to take, not give 📞

Chase Craig ($2B in sales) asks: Are you handing out gold bars or asking for money? Most agents call when they NEED something.

Gold bars = exclusive market updates, off-market properties, neighborhood intel they can't get elsewhere. Value first, always.

Your database has caller ID. And they know exactly why you're calling.

Chase Craig, who's closed $2 billion across 6,000 transactions, puts it perfectly: "Are you asking for money or handing out gold bars?" Most agents call their database when they need something - asking about timelines, pitching services, essentially asking for money.

The top producers flip this completely. They call with exclusive market intelligence, off-market opportunities that match specific criteria, or hyperlocal insights their contacts can't access elsewhere. They lead with value, not need.

This shift changes everything. When you become known as the person who delivers gold bars, your database starts answering because they want what you have, not because they feel obligated.

The litmus test is simple: Before every database call, write down the specific value you're providing. If you can't clearly articulate your "gold bar," don't make the call yet.

What's the most valuable insight you've shared with your database that directly led to new business?
