A $50 million producer in Austin still takes rental clients. While most agents chase only luxury deals, Kristee Leonard built her empire by treating every client—no matter the transaction size—like they're worth millions.

Here's the kicker: One rental client from California turned into multiple high-value referrals. She didn't help them because she's nice—she did it because small clients are your referral engine. The compound effect is real.

Most agents stay stuck not because they take small deals, but because they half-ass them while waiting for "the big one." Every client you serve at full capacity becomes a referral source for your next ten deals.

What's the smallest deal you've given your absolute best service to? I bet it led to something bigger.

While most real estate agents chase only high-end listings, Kristee Leonard—who consistently sells over $50 million annually in Austin—still works with rental clients and first-time buyers.

Her strategy isn't about being nice. It's about compound growth. One rental client from California didn't just become a transaction—they became a referral engine that generated multiple high-value deals.

The insight that changed my perspective: "You're not stuck because you're taking small deals. You're stuck because you're half-assing them while waiting for the big one." Every client interaction is an investment in future business.

Leonard's $50 million year included rental transactions. She understood that consistent, high-quality service across all price points creates a referral network that scales exponentially.

How are you treating your smaller transactions? Are you viewing them as stepping stones or building blocks for long-term success?
