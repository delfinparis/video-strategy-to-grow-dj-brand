Top producer Tim Burrell just shared something that'll blow your mind: he runs every offer through AI before hitting send. No more guessing if you're being strategic or insulting.

Here's what happens when most agents wing it: they lowball thinking they're being clever, the seller gets offended and ghosts them, then they spend weeks trying to apologize their way back into the deal. Tim's approach? Feed the situation to ChatGPT or Claude first - the seller's motivation, your client's position, the offer amount - then ask for the three most probable responses.

It's like having a crystal ball for negotiations. AI shows you exactly where that line is between "strategic" and "insulting" before you accidentally cross it and kill the deal.

Think about your last negotiation that went sideways. What would've changed if you'd known their reaction before you sent that offer?

AI caught what would've killed my last deal 🤯 Here's the exact prompt top producers use before every offer

Most agents learn they went too low AFTER the seller ghosts them. Tim Burrell runs every offer through AI first - feeds it the seller's motivation, client's position, offer amount, then asks for 3 probable responses.

It's a negotiation simulator that shows you where the line is between "strategic" and "insulting" before you cross it and apologize your way back up.

I watched a top producer in Raleigh completely change how he approaches negotiations - and it's brilliant.

Tim Burrell shared something that stopped me in my tracks: he runs every offer through AI before submitting it to sellers. Not for the numbers - for the psychology.

Most of us have been there. You send what you think is a strategic offer, only to have the seller get offended and ghost you. Then you're stuck apologizing your way back into a deal that may already be dead. Tim's approach eliminates that guesswork entirely.

His process: Before hitting send, he feeds AI the complete scenario - seller's motivation, client's position, the offer amount - then asks for the three most probable responses. It's like having a negotiation simulator that shows you exactly where the line is between "strategic positioning" and "insulting lowball."

The insight that hit me: anchoring works in negotiations, but go insultingly low and you'll spend the rest of the process trying to recover credibility instead of building value.

How many deals have you seen die not because of the final numbers, but because of how the first offer was received?
