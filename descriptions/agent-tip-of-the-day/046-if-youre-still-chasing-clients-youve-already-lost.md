Top 1% producer Jay Cannone hasn't "sold" anyone in years. His secret? When you're marketing right, clients come pre-sold. They've already consumed your content, trust your expertise, and know your values.

By the time they call, you're not pitching—you're consulting. You're not overcoming objections—you're confirming what they already believe. The transaction becomes inevitable because they chose you before they ever met you.

Here's the reality check: Look at your last five deals. How many clients came TO you versus how many did you have to convince? That ratio tells you everything about whether you're attracting or exhausting yourself.

What's one way you're attracting clients instead of chasing them?

If you're exhausted from chasing prospects, you're doing it backwards.

Jay Cannone, a top 1% producer in Fairfield County luxury real estate, shared something that stopped me in my tracks: "Marketing is attracting. Selling is convincing. When you're marketing right, clients come pre-sold."

Think about it—when clients have already consumed your content, trust your expertise, and align with your values, the sales conversation transforms. You're no longer pitching; you're consulting. You're not overcoming objections; you're confirming decisions they've already made.

Here's the litmus test Jay uses: Look at your last five deals. How many clients came to you versus how many did you have to convince? That ratio reveals whether you're building attraction or burning out from persuasion.

The most successful agents I know have flipped this script entirely. They've become the obvious choice before the conversation even begins.

How are you positioning yourself as the inevitable choice in your market?
