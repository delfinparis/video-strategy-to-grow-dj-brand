You lost a $2.3M buyer because your MLS ends at the county line. While you're saying "let me refer you out," three agents in your office already bought Phoenix access for $50/month and they're closing the deals you're giving away.

Chris Linsell just dropped the truth bomb: we don't need to wait for a national MLS. Smart agents are already building their own version by buying secondary MLS access in their top referral markets. They're using Zillow's API to pull comps nationally in 60 seconds. They're staying the primary contact instead of becoming the handoff guy.

Right now, there's probably an agent in your market closing deals you referred out last month. The difference? They invested $150/month in three secondary MLS subscriptions while you waited for the industry to change.

Here's your homework: Open your CRM, filter by "Referred Out - Geographic," find your #1 referral market, and Google their MLS access. Most are $40-60/month. Next client who asks about Denver or Nashville? You're the expert, not the referral source.

What's the #1 market you refer deals to that you wish you could handle yourself?

You lost a $2.3M buyer because your MLS ends at the county line 📍

While you're referring out deals, smart agents are buying secondary MLS access for $50/month and closing YOUR referrals. Chris Linsell says we need a national MLS, but top producers aren't waiting - they're building their own.

Three agents in your office probably have Phoenix access, Nashville access, Miami access. They're pulling comps nationally in 60 seconds while you're filling out referral forms. That $18K commission you just gave away? They would've kept it.

A $2.3M buyer walks away because you can't pull Denver comps. Sound familiar?

While most agents say "let me refer you out," the top 10% are taking a different approach. They're buying secondary MLS access in their top three referral markets for $50/month each. They're using technology to pull national comps in under 60 seconds. Most importantly, they're staying the primary relationship instead of becoming a handoff.

Chris Linsell advocates for a national MLS, and he's right - but smart agents aren't waiting for industry-wide reform. They're creating their own solution today. The result? They're closing deals that used to become referral fees.

The math is brutal: referring out a deal nets you maybe 25% of a 3% commission. Keeping it? You get the full 6%. On a $500K sale, that's $3,750 vs $30,000. Suddenly that $150/month investment in three secondary markets looks pretty smart.

Your action item this week: audit your "Referred Out" deals from last year, identify your top geographic market, and research their MLS subscription options. Most are $40-60/month - less than your monthly CRM cost.

What's preventing you from expanding your geographic expertise beyond referral relationships?
