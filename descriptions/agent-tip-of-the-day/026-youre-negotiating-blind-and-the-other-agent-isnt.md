Most real estate agents lose deals before they even start negotiating. Why? They're walking in blind while top producers already know exactly who they're up against.

Tim Burrell, RE/MAX Hall of Fame producer, revealed his secret weapon: He uses AI to research the other agent's negotiation patterns, transaction history, and pressure points before every deal. "It's like walking into a poker game knowing everyone's tells," he says.

While you're guessing whether they'll budge on repairs or panic when deals stall, the pros already have a complete playbook on their opponent. This isn't about being sneaky – it's about being prepared.

The best part? You can start doing this today with a simple ChatGPT prompt using publicly available data.

What's the most challenging negotiation you've faced recently? Was it because you didn't know enough about the other side?

Here's an uncomfortable truth: You're not losing deals because you lack negotiation skills. You're losing because you're unprepared.

Tim Burrell, a RE/MAX Hall of Fame producer and attorney, shared something that completely shifted my perspective on real estate negotiations. Before every deal, he uses AI to analyze the other agent's complete profile – their transaction patterns, negotiation style, typical concessions, and pressure points.

"It's like walking into a poker game knowing everyone's tells," Tim explained. Within seconds of entering an agent's name, he has actionable intelligence that most agents never think to gather.

While most agents hope for the best, top producers study for success. They know if the listing agent typically caves on inspection repairs. They know if the buyer's agent gets nervous when deals hit roadblocks. This isn't about manipulation – it's about preparation.

The tool is already at your fingertips. A simple ChatGPT prompt with publicly available data can transform how you approach every negotiation.

What would change in your business if you walked into every negotiation knowing exactly who you were up against?
