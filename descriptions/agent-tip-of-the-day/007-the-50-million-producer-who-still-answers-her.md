She's produced over $50 million in sales and still answers her phone at 9 PM. But that's not what makes Kristee Leonard different from every other top producer.

It's what she said about client calls that stopped me in my tracks: "For someone to choose you, it is an honor." Not a transaction. Not a commission. An honor. After 18 years and thousands of deals, she still means it.

Think about it - every person who calls you passed on dozens of other agents. They didn't pick your brokerage or your marketing. They picked YOU. Most agents forget this after a few years and start treating clients like interruptions instead of privileges.

When's the last time you answered your phone like it was an honor instead of an obligation?

After 18 years in luxury real estate and over $50 million in production, Kristee Leonard still answers client calls at 9 PM.

But here's what separates her from agents who burn out: her perspective on client selection. "For someone to choose you, it is an honor," she told me. Not a transaction. Not a commission opportunity. An honor.

Consider this: every person who contacts you passed on dozens of other agents. They didn't choose your brokerage, your marketing, or your brand. They chose YOU personally. Most agents lose sight of this privilege after a few successful years, starting to see client calls as interruptions rather than the foundation of their business.

Kristee's approach isn't just about client service—it's about sustainable success. When you view each interaction as an honor rather than an obligation, your energy, authenticity, and results naturally follow.

How do you frame client interactions in your mind? As honors or obligations?
