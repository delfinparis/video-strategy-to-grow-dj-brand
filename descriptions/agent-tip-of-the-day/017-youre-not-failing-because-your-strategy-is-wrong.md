Month 6: 3 referrals. Most agents would've panicked and switched to buying Zillow leads. Garrett Maroon didn't.

Instead, he stayed committed to his past client database for 24 months straight. Month 12: 8 referrals. Month 18: 17 referrals. Month 24: He completely stopped prospecting because his database became a referral machine.

The problem isn't your strategy. It's that you keep switching strategies before they have time to compound. Your sphere doesn't refer you because they don't know what you actually do anymore—you've been everywhere, so you're nowhere in their mind.

Garrett's advice? "Pick a path and stay there long enough until it works." Consistency isn't sexy, but it's the only thing that builds trust.

What's the ONE lead source you're going to commit to for the next 18 months?

Month 6: 3 referrals. Most agents would've panicked. Garrett didn't. He stayed committed to his database for 24 months.

The result? Month 24: He stopped prospecting entirely. His past clients became a referral machine generating 17+ referrals by month 18.

Your database doesn't trust you because you haven't been consistent long enough. You've been everywhere, so you're nowhere in their mind.

Garrett Maroon had 3 referrals at month 6. Most real estate professionals would have pivoted to paid lead generation at that point. He didn't.

By staying committed to his past client database strategy for 24 months, something remarkable happened. Month 12: 8 referrals. Month 18: 17 referrals. Month 24: He stopped prospecting entirely because his database became a self-sustaining referral engine.

The insight that changed everything? "Pick a path and stay there long enough until it works." The compound effect only kicks in when you stop restarting every few months.

Your sphere of influence doesn't refer business to you because they don't know what you consistently do anymore. When you're everywhere, you're effectively nowhere in their minds.

In a world obsessed with the next shiny strategy, consistency remains the unsexy differentiator that builds lasting trust and sustainable business growth.

What's the one business development strategy you're willing to commit to for the next 18 months, regardless of early results?
