Most real estate agents think they're committed to their goals. Then December hits, and their calendars tell the truth—they're just interested.

Mindset coach Paul Salter puts it perfectly: "Committed people don't negotiate with circumstances." While interested agents make excuses about holidays, weather, and timing, committed agents show up every single day. Even December 23rd.

Here's the reality: interested agents reset every January. Committed agents separate in December. While everyone else is at holiday parties, they're building January's pipeline and calling past clients.

The litmus test? Call five past clients tomorrow morning before 10am. Just check in. "Hey, thinking of you before the holidays." That's what commitment looks like when circumstances get tough.

What separates you in December—commitment or excuses?

December is the litmus test—are you committed or just interested? 🎯

Most agents negotiate with circumstances. "I'll work hard... unless it's the holidays." Committed agents? They don't need perfect conditions.

Here's your test: Call 5 past clients tomorrow before 10am. Just check in. That's what separation looks like while everyone else checks out.

December reveals who's truly committed to their real estate business versus who's just interested.

Most agents negotiate with circumstances: "I'll prospect hard... unless it's cold, unless it's the holidays, unless my kids are off school." They block out December 15th through January 2nd and wonder why they're resetting every year.

Mindset coach Paul Salter works with top producers, and he sees a clear pattern: committed agents don't need perfect conditions. They show up every day, even December 23rd. While interested agents make excuses, committed agents make calls.

Here's the separation strategy: tomorrow morning, before 10am, call five past clients you haven't spoken to in six months. Simple check-in: "Hey, thinking of you before the holidays." That's it. Five calls that most agents won't make because it's "not the right time."

The agents who build million-dollar businesses understand this: interested agents reset every January, but committed agents separate in December.

Are you using December to separate or to check out?
