Seven-figure real estate agents aren't burning out from the work. They're burning out from lying to themselves about what they actually want.

Paul Salter just coached a 15-year veteran doing $8 million in production who kept saying she wanted "balance." When he called BS, the truth came out: she wanted to build a $20 million team and retire her husband. But she'd been pretending she wanted a lifestyle business because that's what her friends respected.

The result? She was doing the work of a $20 million producer while telling herself (and her family) she wanted less. That incongruency was killing her. The moment she got honest about her real goals, the resentment stopped. Not because the work changed, but because the lie ended.

Tonight's homework: Write down what you ACTUALLY want in the next 24 months, then what that will actually require. Stop lying to yourself first.

What's the biggest lie you've been telling yourself about your real estate goals?

The most successful real estate professionals aren't burning out from the work itself. They're burning out from the lies they tell themselves about what they're building.

Paul Salter, who coaches seven-figure agents, shared a powerful story about a 15-year veteran producing $8 million annually. She kept insisting she wanted "work-life balance," but when pressed, the truth emerged: she wanted to build a $20 million team and create enough wealth to retire her husband.

The problem wasn't her ambition. It was the incongruency between her real goals and the story she told herself (and others) about wanting a "lifestyle business." She was doing the work of a $20 million producer while pretending she wanted less - creating massive internal conflict.

The breakthrough came when she got honest about what she actually wanted to build. The resentment disappeared not because the work changed, but because the lie ended. Clear communication with yourself enables clear communication with your family about what your goals actually require.

Here's the exercise: Write two sentences. "What I actually want in the next 24 months is..." and "What that will actually require is..." 

What's the biggest disconnect between what you say you want and what you're actually building?
