# Karina Chavez answered a 7pm call...

**Guest:** Karina Chavez | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets
**Score:** 9 | **Rank:** 16 of 62

> **Strongest Line:** "People don't want to leave voicemails about six-figure decisions. They want a human. Right now."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Karina Chavez answered a 7pm call last Tuesday. It turned into a $480,000 listing by Thursday.

*Production: Phone screen showing 7:04pm incoming call. Quick cut to Karina signing listing agreement two days later.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
She's a top 1% producer in Albuquerque who built her business entirely on referrals. Her number one rule? So simple most agents ignore it.

*Production: B-roll of Karina at closing table, hugging clients. Her phone buzzing on the table throughout.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
"Always answer your phone. You never know what you're going to get." That Tuesday call? A past client's coworker whose agent went dark during inspection. She needed someone who'd actually pick up. Most agents saw a random evening number and let it ring. Karina answered on the second ring. Here's what nobody tells you — people don't want to leave voicemails about six-figure decisions. They want a human. Right now. And they'll move to the next agent in their contacts faster than you think.

*Production: Show Karina's phone ringing at 7:04pm. Text overlay: 'Past client referral - needs agent NOW'. Cut to Karina answering enthusiastically. Show competitor's phone going to voicemail with 'call declined' animation.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
You're at 30 deals this year and can't figure out why you're plateaued. Meanwhile, you sent four calls to voicemail last week because you were 'busy.' One of those could've been your easiest $15,000 of the year.

*Production: Split screen: Agent ignoring call while scrolling social media vs. calculator showing $15,000 commission. Agent's expression shifts from defensive to 'oh shit' realization.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Right now — not tomorrow — go into your phone settings. Turn off 'Silence Unknown Callers.' Then answer every single call for the next seven days. Keep a note in your phone: who called, what they wanted. Report back next Friday on what you found.

*Production: Screen recording showing iPhone Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers being toggled OFF. Text overlay: 'ANSWER EVERY CALL - 7 DAYS' with checkbox. End on Karina answering phone with genuine smile.*
