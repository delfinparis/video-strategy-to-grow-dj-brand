# You're not failing because your strategy...

**Guest:** Garrett Maroon | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Real Talk
**Score:** 9 | **Rank:** 17 of 62
**Post Date:** Thursday, April 02, 2026

> **Strongest Line:** "Month six: three referrals. Most agents would've panicked and bought Zillow leads. He didn't."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
You're not failing because your strategy is wrong. You're failing because you won't stop switching strategies.

*Production: Hard cut to Garrett. Text overlay: 'You're not failing because your strategy is wrong.' Pause. Then second line appears.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Garrett Maroon built a top 1% referral-based business in Southeast Virginia. His secret? He picked ONE lead source in 2018 and never looked back. That lead source was his past client database.

*Production: B-roll: Garrett with clients, sold signs, testimonials. Text overlay: 'Top 1% | 2018: Picked ONE Source | Southeast VA'*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's what he told me: 'Pick a path and stay there long enough until it works.' In month six, he had three referrals. Most agents would've panicked and bought Zillow leads. He didn't. Month twelve: eight referrals. Month eighteen: seventeen. By month twenty-four, he stopped prospecting entirely. His database became a machine. But here's the thing — nothing magical happened at month six. Or twelve. The compound effect only kicks in when you stop restarting.

*Production: Split screen: Left side shows Garrett speaking. Right side shows animated timeline with EXACT numbers — 'Month 6: 3 referrals,' 'Month 12: 8 referrals,' 'Month 18: 17 referrals,' 'Month 24: Stopped prospecting.' Use kinetic text for the quote and numbers.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Your database doesn't trust you because you haven't been consistent long enough. Your sphere doesn't refer you because they don't know what you actually do anymore. You've been everywhere, so you're nowhere in their mind. Consistency isn't sexy. But it's the only thing that builds trust.

*Production: Close-up on Garrett. Slower pace. Text overlay: 'Consistency > Strategy' then 'Everywhere = Nowhere'*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Tonight, before bed: Open your phone. Text three past clients this exact message: 'Hey [name], been thinking about you. How's [specific thing you remember about them]? Let's grab coffee soon.' Send it. That's day one of your 18-month commitment. Tomorrow, three more. Start the clock.

*Production: Direct to camera. Text overlay shows the EXACT message template on a phone screen mockup. Final frame: 'Day 1 of 18 months. Go.'*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Garrett stayed with his database for 24 months. Month 6: 3 referrals. Month 24: stopped prospecting. The strategy works when you do.

## Judge Note
The month-by-month breakdown is chef's kiss—this is how you make 'consistency' tangible instead of motivational fluff.
