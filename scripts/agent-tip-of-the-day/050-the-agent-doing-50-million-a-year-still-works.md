# The agent doing $50 million a...

**Guest:** Kristee Leonard | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets
**Score:** 8 | **Rank:** 50 of 62
**Post Date:** Thursday, June 18, 2026

> **Strongest Line:** "You're not stuck because you're taking small deals. You're stuck because you're half-assing them while waiting for the big one."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
The agent doing $50 million a year still works rentals.

*Production: Text on screen: '$50M PRODUCER' — then cut to Kristee speaking directly to camera*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Most agents think the path to luxury is saying no to small deals. Kristee Leonard — who sells over $50 million a year in Austin — does the opposite.

*Production: B-roll: luxury home exteriors, then cut to Kristee in interview setting*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
She still takes rental clients. Still works with first-time buyers. And here's why: 'If you choose to take on that client, then you need to represent them just like if they were a multimillion dollar deal.' One of those rentals? Came from California. Turned into multiple referrals. She's not treating small clients well because it's nice — she's doing it because it's how you build a referral engine that compounds. The year she sold $50 million? She was still working rentals.

*Production: Cut between Kristee speaking and text overlays of key phrases: 'SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE' / 'ONE RENTAL = MULTIPLE REFERRALS' / '$50M YEAR + STILL WORKING RENTALS'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
You're not stuck because you're taking small deals. You're stuck because you're half-assing them while waiting for the big one. Treat every client like they're the referral source to your next ten — because they are.

*Production: Direct to camera, tight shot on Kristee's face for authority*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Think about your last small client. Did you give them the same energy as your biggest deal? If not — that's the gap. Full episode in bio.

*Production: End card: 'FULL EPISODE: LINK IN BIO' with podcast artwork*

## Social Media
**Caption:** The $50M agent still works rentals. Here's why that's the strategy, not the sacrifice.
**Hashtags:** #RealEstateAgent #LuxuryRealEstate #RealEstateTips #AgentMindset #RealEstateSuccess
**Share Trigger:** identity — validates agents who work 'all levels' while challenging those who ghost small clients

## Judge Note
The CTA is too vague — tell them exactly what to do differently on their next small client (specific behavior, not just 'think about it').
