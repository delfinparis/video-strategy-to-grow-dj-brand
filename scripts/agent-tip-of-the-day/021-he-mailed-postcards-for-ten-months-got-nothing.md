# He mailed postcards for ten months....

**Guest:** Jay Cannone | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Real Talk
**Score:** 9 | **Rank:** 21 of 62

> **Strongest Line:** "Anybody who sends me these postcards as consistently as you've done for the past ten months—that's who I want to work with."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
He mailed postcards for ten months. Got nothing. Zero calls. Almost went bankrupt.

*Production: Text on screen: '10 MONTHS. $0 RESULTS.' Anxious, tense music.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Jay Cannone's a top 1% producer now. But back then? He was on a conference call with other agents celebrating wins while he was sitting there broke. Ready to quit the whole marketing thing.

*Production: B-roll: Empty desk, bills piled up. Cut to Jay's headshot with 'TOP 1% PRODUCER' credential.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Month eleven. A luxury seller calls. Jay asks why him. The guy says: 'Anybody who sends me these postcards as consistently as you've done for the past ten months—that's who I want to work with.' Not the best design. Not the cleverest copy. Consistency. The seller had been watching. Testing. Waiting to see if Jay would quit like everyone else.

*Production: Overlay: Phone ringing. Cut to Jay's actual quote as audio. Text on screen: 'MONTH 11.' Then: 'CONSISTENCY = CREDIBILITY.'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
You think nobody's noticing your marketing. They are. They're just not ready yet. Every postcard, every email, every video—it's a deposit. And the people worth working with? They're counting.

*Production: Slow-motion B-roll: Mail being delivered, emails landing in inbox. Calm, hopeful music shift.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So here's the question: What marketing did you quit on at month nine? Full episode link in bio—Jay breaks down the exact system that saved his career.

*Production: Text on screen: 'WHAT DID YOU QUIT ON?' Freeze on Jay's face. End card: 'FULL EPISODE 🔗'*

## Social Media
**Caption:** He almost quit at month 10. Month 11 changed everything. The full story will gut you.
**Hashtags:** #RealEstateMarketing #Consistency #TopProducer #RealEstateAgent #LuxuryRealEstate
**Share Trigger:** identity

## Judge Note
The CTA pivot to 'what did you quit on' is brilliant but gets diluted by the 'full episode' pitch—pick one action.
