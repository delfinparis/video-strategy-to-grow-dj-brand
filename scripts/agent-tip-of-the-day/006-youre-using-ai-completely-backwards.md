# You're using AI completely backwards.

> **Strongest Line:** "I use AI to clean up my thoughts instead of generate them."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
You're using AI completely backwards.

*Production: Text on screen: 'You're using AI completely backwards.' Quick cut to Eithan mid-conversation, serious expression.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Most agents are trying to get ChatGPT to write their emails, their posts, their scripts. And it sounds like a robot wrote it. Eithan Davidov closes over 100 deals a year in Queens. He uses AI differently.

*Production: B-roll: generic AI-generated text examples, robotic voice overlay. Cut to Eithan's face with text overlay: '100+ transactions/year'*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
His rule: 'I use AI to clean up my thoughts instead of generate them.' Here's what that actually looks like. Voice memo after a listing appointment — messy, incomplete thoughts about the seller's concerns. Dump it into AI. Ask it to organize, not create. What comes back is YOUR voice. YOUR insights. Just structured. Same thing with follow-up sequences. You write the raw version. The stuff you'd actually say. AI tightens it, finds the gaps, makes it coherent. You stay human. You just get clearer, faster.

*Production: Screen recording: voice memo transcription being pasted into ChatGPT with prompt visible: 'Organize these thoughts, keep my voice.' Show before/after side by side. Highlight the preserved personality in the 'after.'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Because here's what nobody tells you — the bottleneck isn't ideas. You have plenty of those. The bottleneck is turning the chaos in your head into something you can actually send. AI as a thought-cleaner? That's the unlock.

*Production: Close-up of Eithan speaking directly to camera. Cut to visual metaphor: cluttered desk transforming to organized workspace.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Try this today. Record a 2-minute voice memo about your last client interaction. Transcribe it. Ask AI to organize your thoughts, not rewrite them. See what happens.

*Production: Text on screen with each step appearing as spoken. End on Eithan's face with text: 'Clean up your thoughts. Not replace them.'*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Stop asking AI to write FOR you. Ask it to organize what's already in your head. Game changer.

## Judge Note
Show the before/after of one actual voice memo → AI output so viewers can see the transformation instead of just hearing about it.
