# You're not stuck because you don't...

**Guest:** Connie Mahan | **Avatar:** Overwhelmed Newbie | **Pillar:** Real Talk
**Score:** 9 | **Rank:** 13 of 62
**Post Date:** Tuesday, March 24, 2026

> **Strongest Line:** "Tomorrow morning at 9am—not 'when you feel ready'—pull up your MLS. Find three expired listings from the last thirty days. Call them. Use this exact script: 'Hi, I saw your home didn't sell. I'd love five minutes to tell you what I'd do differently.'"

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
You're not stuck because you don't know enough. You're stuck because you won't move.

*Production: Hard cut to Connie. No music. Direct eye contact. Let the silence land.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Connie Mahan—REALTOR of the Year, broker owner in Central Florida—closed her first deal before she finished her first training module. That's not reckless. That's how it actually works.

*Production: B-roll: awards, office signage, team in action. Fast cuts. Show credibility without lingering.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
She says the best advice she ever got was this: 'Get in and do, and the rest will figure itself out.' Not take another certification. Not perfect your scripts. Do. She called her first expired listing with sweaty palms and a half-written script. She door-knocked a neighborhood where she mispronounced street names. She hosted an open house where exactly two people showed up. And every single one of those messy moments taught her more than any course ever could. Because you don't learn real estate in theory—you learn it in the wreckage of trying.

*Production: Cut to Connie delivering the quote on camera. Then quick montage: shaky hand holding phone, knocking on door, empty open house with balloons. Show the reality of 'doing' visually.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
So if you're waiting to feel confident, you've got it backwards. Confidence doesn't create action. Action creates confidence. The agent who makes fifty awkward calls will always outperform the one who rehearses the perfect pitch.

*Production: Return to Connie. Tighter shot. Let her lean in slightly. This is the conviction moment.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Tomorrow morning at 9am—not 'when you feel ready'—pull up your MLS. Find three expired listings from the last thirty days. Call them. Use this exact script: 'Hi, I saw your home didn't sell. I'd love five minutes to tell you what I'd do differently.' That's it. Three calls. 9am. Go.

*Production: End card with text overlay: '9AM TOMORROW: 3 expired listing calls.' Connie's face visible behind text, nodding.*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Stop studying. Start doing. The rest figures itself out.

## Judge Note
This is nearly perfect—only tweak is to cut 'Because you don't learn real estate in theory—you learn it in the wreckage of trying' which feels slightly overwritten for the voice.
