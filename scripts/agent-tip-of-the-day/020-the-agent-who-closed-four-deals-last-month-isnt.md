# The agent who closed four deals...

**Guest:** Kristee Leonard | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets
**Score:** 9 | **Rank:** 20 of 62

> **Strongest Line:** "Right now — not tomorrow, NOW — open your phone. Text five past clients this exact message: 'Quick question: who do you know thinking about moving in the next 6 months?'"

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
The agent who closed four deals last month isn't smarter than you.

*Production: B-roll: Office setting, agent celebrating at desk with 'SOLD' notifications on screen. Contrast with another agent looking frustrated.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
They just made forty-seven calls while you were rewriting your bio. Kristee Leonard — $50 million producer in Austin — doesn't win on strategy. She wins on reps.

*Production: Cut to Kristee's headshot or footage. Text overlay: '$50M+ Producer, Austin TX' then 'REPS > STRATEGY'*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
She told me: 'You don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room.' Translation: While they're researching the perfect CRM, you're texting twenty past clients 'Hey, who do you know moving this spring?' While they're planning their content calendar, you're recording three sixty-second neighborhood tours on your iPhone. While they're at a networking mixer, you're sending handwritten notes to your last ten closings. Smarts get you in the room. Reps win the room.

*Production: Split screen: Left side shows 'planning/researching' (agent staring at laptop). Right side shows 'executing' (texting, filming on phone, writing notes). Text overlays of exact actions: 'Text 20 past clients' 'Record 3 tours' 'Send 10 notes'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
You've been waiting to feel ready. To know enough. To have the right scripts. But every hour you wait, someone with half your knowledge and twice your hustle is closing YOUR deal. The learning phase is over.

*Production: Direct to camera or Kristee footage. Slow push-in. Text overlay: 'Someone with half your knowledge and twice your hustle'*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Right now — not tomorrow, NOW — open your phone. Text five past clients this exact message: 'Quick question: who do you know thinking about moving in the next 6 months?' Send it before this video ends. That's forty-five seconds of work that beats four hours of planning.

*Production: Screen record of phone opening messages app. Text overlay: 'TEXT 5 PAST CLIENTS NOW' with the exact message displayed. Timer counting down from 0:45.*

## Judge Note
Cut 'The learning phase is over' (too coaching-speak) and the hook could be sharper with a number: 'The agent who closed four deals last month made 47 more calls than you.'
