# A $40 million producer just admitted...

**Guest:** Bari Mill | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets
**Score:** 8 | **Rank:** 32 of 62

> **Strongest Line:** "She treats it like brushing her teeth — boring, non-negotiable, done before she can talk herself out of it."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
A $40 million producer just admitted she's terrible at CRM.

*Production: Text on screen: '$40M PRODUCER'. Cut to Bari's face mid-confession.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Bari Mill closes 40 million a year in Chicago. And the thing she avoids most? The same thing you do. Updating her database. But here's what she figured out.

*Production: B-roll of Chicago skyline, then cut to Bari speaking. Text overlay: 'Chicago Top Producer'*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
She said: 'CRM is something that is not that hard, and if I just set an alarm or a timer to input clients for 10 minutes a day, it's not that hard.' Ten minutes. Not an hour. Not a Sunday afternoon catch-up session where you hate your life. A timer. Every day. She treats it like brushing her teeth — boring, non-negotiable, done before she can talk herself out of it.

*Production: Show phone timer being set for 10 minutes. Cut between Bari's quote and screen recording of CRM being updated. Text overlay: '10 MINUTES. EVERY DAY.'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Because the agents who do 40 million aren't superhuman. They just don't let the boring stuff pile up into a crisis. Ten minutes today beats three hours of panic next month.

*Production: Split screen: messy CRM vs. clean CRM. Cut to Bari nodding.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So set the timer. Right now. Before you close this app. Ten minutes. See if she's right.

*Production: Close-up of phone timer starting. Text: 'SET THE TIMER NOW.' Fade to Bari's face.*

## Social Media
**Caption:** 40M producer admits she's bad at CRM. Her fix? 10 minutes a day. That's it.

## Judge Note
The 'brushing teeth' metaphor is gold — consider ending with 'Set the timer before you finish reading this' instead of 'before you close this app' for platform flexibility.
