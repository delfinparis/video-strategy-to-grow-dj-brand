## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Most agents pay for tools. Top producers build them.

*Production: Split screen: Left side shows SaaS subscription invoices stacking up ($49/mo, $99/mo, $149/mo visible). Right side shows a custom tool interface with agent's branding.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
D.J. Paris runs recruitment and AI strategy for a Chicago brokerage. Last month he built a custom mortgage affordability calculator for his agents. Took him 47 minutes. Zero coding experience. And now his agents look like wizards to their buyers.

*Production: B-roll of D.J.'s actual mortgage calculator tool. Show the clean interface, sliders moving, results calculating in real-time. Show his brokerage logo in the corner.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's what he did: He opened ChatGPT and typed, 'Build me an HTML mortgage calculator that shows monthly payment, required income, and down payment scenarios for Chicago buyers.' ChatGPT wrote the code. He copied it. Pasted it into a free Carrd page. Fifteen minutes of tweaking the colors and adding his logo. Done. He's not talking about hiring a dev team. He's talking about the fact that AI will write functional code for you in 90 seconds. Mortgage calculator? Done. Neighborhood comparison tool? Done. School district report generator? Done. You own it. You control it. Your branding. Your client data. No monthly subscription bleeding you dry.

*Production: Screen recording showing the ACTUAL ChatGPT prompt typed out word-for-word. Show ChatGPT generating the code. Show him copying it. Show him pasting into Carrd. Show the live tool working with real Chicago numbers. Fast cuts but clear enough to follow.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
This isn't about being tech-savvy. It's about realizing the barrier between 'I wish I had that' and 'I built that' just collapsed. Every tool you wish existed? You can build it this week. And your clients will think you hired a developer.

*Production: Show three different custom tools in action — mortgage calculator, neighborhood comparison, market report generator. Each one solving a specific client pain point. Agent branding visible on each. Fast cuts, energy building.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Tonight before bed: Open ChatGPT. Type this exact prompt: 'Build me an HTML tool that calculates monthly mortgage payments with sliders for price, down payment, and interest rate.' Copy the code it gives you. Paste it into Carrd.co—it's free. Tomorrow, text it to your next buyer. That's it. That's the assignment.

*Production: Text overlay showing the exact prompt typed out clearly. Then show the three steps as bullet points: 1) Open ChatGPT 2) Use this prompt 3) Paste into Carrd. D.J. to camera for last line, direct eye contact.*

## Judge Note
This is nearly perfect—only improvement would be showing a 10-second screen recording of the actual tool being built in the video itself.
