# Your buyers aren't walking away from...

**Guest:** Carrie McCormick | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets
**Score:** 8 | **Rank:** 43 of 62
**Post Date:** Tuesday, June 02, 2026

> **Strongest Line:** "One agent gave a number. One gave certainty. Guess who got the listing."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Your buyers aren't walking away from the house. They're walking away from you.

*Production: Hard cut to Carrie mid-sentence, tight frame. Text overlay: 'They're walking away from YOU'*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Carrie McCormick — top 1% producer in Chicago luxury — just told me why deals die. And it has nothing to do with the property.

*Production: B-roll: Carrie's credentials (top 1%, Chicago skyline). Quick cuts to keep pace.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's what she said: 'Buyers don't reject homes. They reject uncertainty.' Here's what that looks like in real life. Carrie's presenting a $2.1M listing. Buyer asks why it's priced there. Weak agent says: 'Market analysis supports it.' Carrie says: 'Two comps closed 90 days ago at $1.95M. Since then, inventory dropped 40% in this zip code. We priced at $2.1M because we're launching with a 72-hour social blitz, broker event Tuesday, and if we don't get action in 10 days, we adjust. Here's the timeline.' One agent gave a number. One gave certainty. Guess who got the listing.

*Production: Show Carrie speaking the quote. Cut to text overlays: '$2.1M listing' / 'Inventory dropped 40%' / '72-hour blitz' / 'Here's the timeline.' B-roll of listing presentations, data sheets, calendar graphics.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
So the next time a buyer ghosts after a showing? It's not the house. It's that you gave them a price without a plan. You gave them doubt instead of direction.

*Production: Return to Carrie, slightly wider frame. Text: 'Price without a PLAN.' Slow push-in for emphasis.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Tomorrow morning, take your next listing. Write out three sentences: Why this price. Why this week. What happens in 10 days if we're wrong. Say it out loud before your presentation. That's the script. Full episode in bio.

*Production: Text overlay: 'Tomorrow morning: Write 3 sentences' / 'Why this price / Why this week / What if we're wrong' / 'Say it OUT LOUD.' End card with podcast branding and 'Link in bio'*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Buyers don't reject homes. They reject uncertainty. Carrie McCormick shows exactly what that means in a listing presentation.

## Judge Note
The CTA is too generic for how specific the insight is — give them the exact three-sentence template to copy-paste, not just the concept.
