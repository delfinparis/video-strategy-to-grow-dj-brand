# Your database doesn't answer because they...

**Guest:** Chase Craig | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets

> **Strongest Line:** "When you're calling your database, are you asking for money or are you handing out gold bars?"

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Your database doesn't answer because they know you're calling to take, not give.

*Production: Text on screen: 'Your database knows.' Cut to Chase mid-sentence, intense eye contact.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Chase Craig — two billion in sales, six thousand transactions — says most agents have this backwards. And it's killing their conversion. Here's what he means.

*Production: Quick B-roll of phone screen with unanswered calls. Chase's stats appear as text overlays.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
He asks: When you're calling your database, are you asking for money or are you handing out gold bars? Most agents call when they need a deal. They ask about timing. They pitch their services. That's asking for money. Handing out gold bars? That's calling with a market update they can't get anywhere else. A off-market property that fits their criteria. Intel on their neighborhood. Value first. Always.

*Production: Split screen: 'Asking for Money' vs 'Handing Out Gold Bars' with examples under each. Cut back to Chase delivering the metaphor with hand gestures.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
When you become the person who gives gold bars, your database starts answering. Because they want what you have. Not because they feel guilty ignoring you.

*Production: Close-up of Chase. Text overlay: 'They want what you have.' Cut to visual of phone ringing, being answered.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So before your next database call — write down the gold bar you're giving. If you can't name it, don't make the call yet. Go find the gold first.

*Production: Chase pointing at camera. Final frame: 'Find the gold first.' Show notepad with 'My Gold Bar:' written at top.*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Stop asking for money. Start handing out gold bars. Your database will know the difference.

## Judge Note
The CTA is slightly soft—tell them exactly what one gold bar looks like (e.g., 'Text them the three homes that just hit market in their zip code').
