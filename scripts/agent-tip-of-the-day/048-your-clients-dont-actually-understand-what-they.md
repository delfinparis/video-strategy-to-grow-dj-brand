## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Your clients don't actually understand what they bought.

*Production: Text on screen: 'Your clients don't understand...' Over B-roll of keys being handed over at closing*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Karina Chavez — top 1% producer in Albuquerque — watched the 2008 crash destroy her community. Interest-only loans. Predatory lenders. Families who thought they understood, but didn't.

*Production: Quick cuts of Karina speaking, then archival footage of foreclosure signs from 2008*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
So now? She prints every loan document. Goes page by page. Fixed rate — it never changes. Taxes. Insurance. Everything. Not because she's a loan officer. Because she learned something most agents miss: Your job isn't done at closing. One of her clients called her years later, panicking about a medical crisis. Karina reminded her: 'This is what your house is for. This is what all the sacrifices have been for.' Equity. Security. A way forward.

*Production: Split screen: Karina explaining documents on one side, then cut to emotional moment of her recounting the story. Text overlay on 'This is what your house is for'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
You're not selling houses. You're selling the thing that catches people when they fall. But only if they actually understand what they own. That's the difference between a transaction and a relationship that lasts decades.

*Production: Karina speaking directly to camera, intimate framing*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Ask yourself: Could your clients explain their mortgage to their kids? If not, you're leaving them vulnerable. Full episode — link in bio.

*Production: End card with episode thumbnail and 'Link in bio' text*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Your clients don't understand what they bought. And that's on you. 🏠

## Judge Note
Hook needs more specificity — try 'Your clients can't explain their own mortgage' to match the tactical energy of the rest.
