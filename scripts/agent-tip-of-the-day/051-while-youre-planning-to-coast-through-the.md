# While you're planning to coast through...

**Guest:** Paul Salter | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Real Talk

> **Strongest Line:** "While you're planning to coast through the holidays, someone else is planning to bury you."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
While you're planning to coast through the holidays, someone else is planning to bury you.

*Production: B-roll: Split screen — one agent closing laptop early, another making calls at dusk. Tension in the edit.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Every December, same story. Market slows. Competitors disappear. You tell yourself you'll go hard in January. Paul Salter, mindset coach to top producers, calls BS on that story.

*Production: Cut to Paul on camera. Clean background. Direct eye contact.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
He says these next few months — the winter months, the holiday season — view it as separation season. Not downtime. Separation season. Because while 80% of agents are using the holidays as an excuse, the top 5% are using it as a weapon. They're calling past clients who closed six months ago. They're texting sphere contacts who haven't heard from them since summer. They're door-knocking expired listings on Saturday mornings when no one else will. They're building the pipeline that explodes in Q1 while everyone else is scrambling. The gap between you and them? It doesn't widen in January. It widens right now.

*Production: Text on screen: 'SEPARATION SEASON' in bold. Cut between Paul speaking and footage of agents working — calls, open houses in winter, follow-up texts at night.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
So the question isn't whether the market slows down. It's whether you do. Because every year you coast through December, you're not just losing a month. You're losing the compounding advantage of being the only one still showing up.

*Production: Close-up on Paul. Slow zoom. Let the weight sit.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Tomorrow morning, open your CRM. Pull every past client who closed in the last 12 months. Send them a personal voice note — 15 seconds — checking in. Not selling. Just showing up. Do that before lunch. That's separation. Full episode in bio.

*Production: End card: 'SEPARATION SEASON' with podcast logo and link. Text overlay: 'Pull last 12 months → Voice note → Before lunch.' Subtle motion graphic.*

## Social Media
**Caption:** December isn't downtime. It's separation season. Are you widening the gap or falling behind?

## Judge Note
The CTA is perfect but the setup repeats 'separation season' too many times — trust the concept and let the examples do the work.
