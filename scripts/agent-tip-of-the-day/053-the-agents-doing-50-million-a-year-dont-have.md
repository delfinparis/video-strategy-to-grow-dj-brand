# The agents doing $50 million a...

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
The agents doing $50 million a year don't have difficult clients.

*Production: Bold text overlay on black background. Cut to Kristee mid-sentence, serious expression.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Kristee Leonard moves over $50 million in luxury real estate in Austin every single year. And when I asked her about client management, she said something that stopped me cold.

*Production: B-roll of luxury Austin properties. Quick cuts. Upbeat but focused energy.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
She said: 'It's an honor to be chosen by clients, and I treat them like they're an honor.' Not 'I tolerate them.' Not 'I manage expectations.' She sees being chosen as a privilege. So when a client texts at 9 PM? That's not an interruption — that's someone who trusted her with the biggest financial decision of their life. When someone asks to see a property three times? That's not annoying — that's someone making sure they get it right. The reframe is everything.

*Production: Show Kristee speaking the quote on screen. Then cut to text overlays of the reframes ('9 PM text = privilege' / 'Third showing = diligence'). Use split-screen to contrast attitudes.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Here's what changes: When you treat being chosen as an honor, you stop resenting the work. You stop complaining about clients. And they feel it. That energy is the difference between a transaction and a referral machine.

*Production: Slow zoom on Kristee's face. Overlay text: 'They feel it.' Cut to testimonial-style footage or 5-star reviews.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So ask yourself: Do your clients feel like an honor to work with? Or do they feel like they're bothering you? That answer is your business in 12 months.

*Production: Direct-to-camera moment. Text overlay of the question. Fade to podcast logo and 'Full episode in bio.'*

## Social Media
**Caption:** The $50M agent who never complains about clients. Here's why. 🎯
**Hashtags:** #RealEstateAgent #LuxuryRealEstate #TopProducer #ClientExperience #RealEstateMindset
**Share Trigger:** identity

## Judge Note
The CTA is too vague — replace with 'Screenshot your last three client texts and ask: would I send this to someone I felt honored to serve?'
