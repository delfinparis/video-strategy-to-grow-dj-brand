# New agents spend six months preparing....

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
New agents spend six months preparing. Top producers spend six days doing.

*Production: Split screen: overwhelmed agent at desk with courses/books vs agent knocking on door*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
You're waiting to feel ready. Waiting for the perfect script, the perfect market, the perfect confidence. Meanwhile, someone who started last week just closed their first deal.

*Production: B-roll: unopened real estate course materials, dusty business cards, calendar days flipping by*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Connie Mahan — REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida — got the advice that changed everything: 'Get in and do. The rest will figure itself out.' Not 'study more.' Not 'wait until you're comfortable.' Do. She didn't know every answer. She learned by showing up. Door-knocking taught her objection handling better than any course. Open houses taught her buyer psychology. Expired listings taught her confidence. The doing created the knowing.

*Production: Quick cuts of agent activities: door-knocking, open house sign, phone calls, showing homes — all with energetic pacing*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Here's what nobody tells you: your first ten conversations will be terrible. And that's the point. You can't learn swimming from a book. You're not unprepared — you're untested. There's a difference.

*Production: Close-up of agent's face showing nerves turning to determination*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So here's your assignment: before you watch another training video, do one thing that scares you. Door-knock five homes. Call three expireds. Host an open house. Then tell me what you learned that no course could've taught you.

*Production: Direct to camera, confident energy. End on freeze frame of agent taking first step out the door*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Stop studying. Start doing. The best training is the one that terrifies you.

## Judge Note
The CTA is strong but generic—name the exact expired script or door-knock opener Connie used in her first week to make it stealable.
