## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
A top 1% luxury agent just said Zillow saved his team.

*Production: Text overlay on black background: 'ZILLOW SAVED HIS TEAM' — then cut to Jeff's face mid-sentence*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Jeff Biebuyck moves luxury properties in Calabasas and Hidden Hills. When his hyper-local market got squeezed, most agents doubled down. He did the opposite.

*Production: B-roll of luxury homes in Calabasas/Hidden Hills, then cut to Jeff speaking*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's what he did: Instead of fighting for scraps in one tight zip code, he used Zillow Flex to spread his team across all of Greater LA. Not as a lead gen tool — as a geographic expansion strategy. His exact words: 'Zillow honestly kind of helps save our team... we were able to diversify spread out across all of greater Los Angeles.' While other luxury agents were waiting for their micro-market to recover, Jeff's team was closing deals in six different areas.

*Production: Show map of LA with multiple pins lighting up. Cut to Jeff's quote. Overlay text: 'DIVERSIFY = SURVIVE'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
This isn't about Zillow. It's about what happens when you stop being precious about your territory and start thinking like a business owner. Your market doesn't owe you deals. Expansion isn't betrayal.

*Production: Close-up of Jeff, serious tone. Text overlay: 'YOUR MARKET DOESN'T OWE YOU DEALS'*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
If you're a team leader and your market's contracting, ask yourself: Are you defending territory or building a business? Full episode link in bio.

*Production: End card with Jeff's name, credentials, and episode CTA. Text: 'TERRITORY OR BUSINESS?'*

## Judge Note
Add one specific result number (how many deals or revenue from the expansion) to make the payoff concrete instead of conceptual.
