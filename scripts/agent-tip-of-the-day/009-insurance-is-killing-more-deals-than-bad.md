# Insurance is killing more deals than...

**Guest:** Jeff Biebuyck | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Market Intelligence

> **Strongest Line:** "Suddenly a $2 million home costs $25K a year just to insure. That's a $2,000 monthly payment your buyer didn't budget for."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Insurance is killing more deals than bad inspections right now.

*Production: Text on screen: 'INSURANCE > INSPECTIONS' with a red X over a house icon. Fast cut energy.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
If you've had a buyer walk after everything looked good, this is probably why. Jeff Biebuyck moves luxury properties in Calabasas and Hidden Hills — top 1% nationwide — and he's watching it happen in real time.

*Production: B-roll of luxury homes, then cut to Jeff speaking. Keep it tight.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's what he told me: 'Insurability became an issue with affordability. We've seen a massive shift in our market.' Translation? Buyers are pre-approved. Inspection's clean. Then they get the insurance quote — if they can even GET insurance — and the numbers don't work anymore. In fire-risk zones, premiums doubled or tripled. In flood zones, policies disappeared entirely. Suddenly a $2 million home costs $25K a year just to insure. That's a $2,000 monthly payment your buyer didn't budget for.

*Production: Show insurance quote examples on screen. Highlight the monthly cost difference. Use visual math: $2M home → $25K insurance → $2K/month.*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Which means you can't just be a real estate agent anymore. You need to know insurance like you know comps. You need carriers who'll actually write policies. You need to set expectations before the offer, not after.

*Production: Cut back to host or Jeff. Serious tone. This is the 'wake up' moment.*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So here's your homework: Call three insurance brokers this week. Ask what's actually insurable in your market right now. Because if you're not having this conversation before escrow, your competition is.

*Production: Text on screen: 'CALL 3 BROKERS THIS WEEK' — make it feel like a checklist item they can screenshot.*

## Social Media
