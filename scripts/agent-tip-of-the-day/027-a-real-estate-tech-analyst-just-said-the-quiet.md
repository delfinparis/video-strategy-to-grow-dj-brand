# A real estate tech analyst just...

**Guest:** Chris Linsell | **Avatar:** Burned Out Veteran | **Pillar:** Real Talk
**Score:** 8 | **Rank:** 27 of 62
**Post Date:** Saturday, April 25, 2026

> **Strongest Line:** "That's less time than it takes to become a licensed barber. And these people are representing someone's $400,000 life decision."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
A real estate tech analyst just said the quiet part out loud: it should be harder to become a REALTOR.

*Production: Bold text overlay: 'HARDER TO BECOME A REALTOR?' over B-roll of crowded new agent orientation or license exam classroom*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Chris Linsell analyzes real estate tech and industry trends for a living. And he thinks the NAR's biggest opportunity isn't marketing or member perks — it's raising the bar to get licensed.

*Production: Show Chris speaking, cut to NAR logo, then back to Chris with serious expression*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's his argument: NAR should partner with state regulators to actually raise licensing standards. Not just enforce ethics after someone screws up — but make it harder to get in. 'The barrier to entry to our industry has to be a little bit higher,' he says. Right now, Texas requires 180 hours. California requires 135. But Alabama? Sixty hours. Georgia? Seventy-five. That's less time than it takes to become a licensed barber. And these people are representing someone's $400,000 life decision. That's the problem.

*Production: Show verbatim quote as text overlay. Cut to map showing state requirements, then split-screen: barber license hours vs. real estate license hours. End on Chris shaking his head*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
If you've been in this business for years — watching part-timers ghost clients mid-transaction and tank your reputation by association — this isn't controversial. It's overdue. The profession doesn't earn respect until the profession demands competence at the door.

*Production: Show frustrated veteran agent at desk, then confident professional agent handing keys to grateful clients*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Here's what to do: go to your state REALTOR association's website right now. Find the 'advocacy' or 'legislative priorities' page. If raising licensing standards isn't on there, email your government affairs director this week and ask why not. That's how change starts.

*Production: Text overlay: '1. Go to state association site 2. Find advocacy page 3. Email gov affairs director' — show cursor clicking through example state site*

## Social Media
**Caption:** Chris Linsell said what burned-out veterans are thinking: it should be harder to get licensed. Alabama requires 60 hours. Barbers need more.

## Judge Note
The CTA is solid but could be sharper — tell them the exact subject line to use in the email ('Add licensing standards to 2025 legislative priorities').
