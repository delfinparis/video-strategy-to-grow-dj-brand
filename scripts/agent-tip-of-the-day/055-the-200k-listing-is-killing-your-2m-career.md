# The $200K listing is killing your...

**Guest:** Kristee Leonard | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Top Producer Secrets
**Score:** 8 | **Rank:** 55 of 62
**Post Date:** Tuesday, June 30, 2026

> **Strongest Line:** "The client you half-repped is the one telling the story at the dinner party."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
The $200K listing is killing your $2M career.

*Production: Text on screen: '$200K listing' then 'killing your $2M career' — bold, contrasting colors. B-roll of modest home exterior.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
Most agents say they treat every client the same. But your calendar, your response time, your staging budget? They tell a different story. Kristee Leonard's built a $50M+ business in Austin luxury — and she says this double standard is the silent killer.

*Production: Split screen: calendar screenshots showing response time differences, then cut to Kristee's headshot with credential text overlay.*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
Here's what she told me: 'If you choose to take on that client, then you need to represent them just like if they were a multimillion dollar deal.' Not 'try to.' Not 'when you can.' Need to. Because that $250K seller? She has a sister looking at $3M properties. That first-time buyer has a boss who just got promoted. You think they're not watching how you show up? The professional photos, the staging consult, the response time at 8 PM — it's all the same standard, or you're building a business on quicksand.

*Production: Overlay Kristee's quote as text. Cut between: professional listing photos, agent on phone at night, staging consultation footage. Visual emphasis on 'same standard.'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
This isn't about being nice. It's about understanding that your reputation isn't built on your biggest deal — it's built on your most inconsistent one. The client you half-repped is the one telling the story at the dinner party.

*Production: B-roll: dinner party scene, people talking. Text overlay: 'Your reputation = your most inconsistent client.'*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
Pull your last ten clients. Honest question: if someone looked at your effort level across all ten, would they see one standard or two? If it's two, you already know what to fix.

*Production: Direct to camera or text overlay with the question. End card: 'One standard or two?' Pause for effect before fade.*

## Social Media
**Caption:** The client you're half-repping is the one killing your referrals. Kristee Leonard on the one standard that built $50M in production.

## Judge Note
The CTA is solid but could be more actionable — add 'Then text the lowest-price client from that list right now and ask if they need anything.'
