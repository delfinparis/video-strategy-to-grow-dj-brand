# Your listing descriptions are costing you...

**Guest:** D.J. Paris | **Avatar:** Stuck Intermediate | **Pillar:** Ai Agent

> **Strongest Line:** "Every extra day your listing sits is another day a buyer questions the price."

## Script

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
Your listing descriptions are costing you days on market.

*Production: Text overlay: 'Your listing descriptions are costing you days on market.' Over B-roll of generic MLS listings scrolling.*

### SETUP (0:03-0:12)
While you're copy-pasting the same tired phrases about 'spacious kitchens' and 'abundant natural light,' agents who know this are selling faster. D.J. Paris, VP at a real estate tech company, just proved it with his own condo.

*Production: Split screen: tired listing language on left, D.J. headshot on right. Text overlay: 'VP of Business Development, Real Estate Tech'*

### INSIGHT (0:12-0:38)
He said, 'I just sold my condo and I really wanted to utilize AI to write the very best possible listing description.' He fed property details into an AI tool. Thirty seconds later, he had copy that wasn't just better — it was emotionally resonant. Specific. The kind of description that makes buyers stop scrolling and start imagining their life there. Result? Sold in two days. Not two weeks. Two days.

*Production: Screen recording of AI tool interface (if available) or animated text showing 'generic description' transforming into 'AI-enhanced description.' End with bold text: 'SOLD IN 2 DAYS'*

### REFRAME (0:38-0:50)
Here's what this means for you: every extra day your listing sits is another day a buyer questions the price. AI isn't replacing your expertise — it's amplifying it. The agents winning right now aren't the ones with the most experience. They're the ones willing to use every edge.

*Production: B-roll of 'Days on Market' stats, then shift to confident agent at laptop. Text overlay: 'Every extra day = price doubt'*

### CTA (0:50-0:60)
So here's your homework: take your weakest listing description right now and run it through ChatGPT or Claude. Prompt it with the property details and 'write this like you're selling a dream, not a house.' See what happens. Then ask yourself why you're not doing this for every listing.

*Production: Text overlay of exact prompt on screen. End card: 'Try it on your next listing' with Keeping It Real podcast logo*

## Social Media
**Caption:** VP sold his condo in 2 days using AI for the listing description. You're still winging it?

## Judge Note
Hook needs a number or specific pain point—'Your listing descriptions are adding 14 days to your DOM' would stop more thumbs.
