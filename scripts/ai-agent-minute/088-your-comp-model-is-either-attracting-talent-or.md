## On-Screen Title
> Your Comp Model Is Either Attracting Talent or Repelling It

## Shareable Moment
> "Most team leaders set splits based on what they've seen other teams do — which is just copying someone else's math without knowing if it works."

## Why This Rank
Team Leader niche only; mathematically rigorous and immediately valuable for that avatar.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your team's compensation model is either attracting the agents you want or quietly pushing them toward the team down the street — and most leaders have never run the actual math to know which. [ON-SCREEN: Is your comp model attracting or repelling talent?]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's how most team comp models get built: a team leader looks at what another team is doing, adjusts slightly, and calls it a day. No analysis of their actual cost per lead. No calculation of what their training investment costs per agent per year. No modeling of what split is required for the team to be profitable while still being attractive to produce agents. The result is either a model that's too thin to bring in top talent — or one so generous it's not sustainable when leads dry up. [ON-SCREEN: Built your comp model by copying someone else's? That's the problem.]
And here's the real cost — a compensation model that's wrong on either end breeds resentment. Too little and agents leave. Too much and you resent them.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to build a compensation model analysis for your team. Give it: your average cost per lead, your team's close rate on those leads, your average commission per deal, your per-agent overhead, and your annual training investment per agent. Ask Claude to calculate: the floor split at which your team remains profitable, how your current model compares to market rates, and what a tiered structure might look like that rewards production growth. Math first. Model second. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Help me build a team comp model analysis. Here are my costs per lead, close rate, average commission, overhead, and training investment."]
The best compensation model isn't the most generous one — it's the one that's sustainable for the team and motivating for the agent at the same time. AI helps you find that number.
Do you know your actual cost per closed deal on your team right now? Yes or no — be honest. [ON-SCREEN: Do you know your cost per closed deal?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Niche audience (team leaders only) but high value for that segment. The "resentment breeds in both directions" agitation is the most emotionally resonant addition. Consider pairing with Script #82 in a team leader themed week.
