## On-Screen Title
> Handle "I Want To Think About It" With AI Practice — Stop Losing Deals

## Shareable Moment
> "Objection handling is a muscle. The agents who don't freeze are the ones who practiced until it felt automatic. AI just made that practice free and unlimited."

## Why This Rank
Highest raw score in the series; objection handling is a universal, perennial pain point with a hook that's impossible not to click.

## Full Script (Spoken)

"I want to think about it." Those five words have cost you more commission than any market downturn ever will. [ON-SCREEN: "Those five words cost you more than any market downturn"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening every time you hear it. You say "of course, take your time" — and you lose the deal. Not because you didn't have a better answer. Because you never practiced having one. When pressure hits, your brain defaults to whatever path feels safest. Silence. Agreement. Retreat.
And here's the painful part — the agents who handle this objection effortlessly aren't smarter than you. They just rehearsed it more than you. [ON-SCREEN: "They just rehearsed it more than you"]
Here's what changes that. Set up a weekly fifteen-minute session with Claude. Type: "Act as a seller who just said 'I want to think about it' after my listing presentation. Stay fully in character as I work through this. Push back the way a real seller would — anxious, skeptical, financially stressed." Run it five times. [ON-SCREEN: "Act as a seller who just said 'I want to think about it' — stay in character"]
By the time you're in the real conversation, you've been there a hundred times.
Objection handling is a muscle. The agents who don't freeze are the ones who practiced until it felt automatic. You can start that practice right now.
What's the objection you dread most? Drop it below — I'll show you how to handle it with AI. [ON-SCREEN: What objection do you dread most?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Highest-scoring script in the batch — this is the series launch candidate. The hook is the best in all 100 scripts. Runs slightly long — trim "anxious, skeptical, financially stressed" to "push back like a real seller would" if needed. Film first.
