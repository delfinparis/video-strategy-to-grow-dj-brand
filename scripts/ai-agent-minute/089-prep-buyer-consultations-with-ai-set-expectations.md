# Prep Buyer Consultations With AI — Set Expectations

**Category:** Conversion & Sales Skills | **Avatar:** All | **AI Tool:** Claude

## On-Screen Title
> Prep Buyer Consultations With AI — Set Expectations Before Problems Start

## Shareable Moment
> "A great buyer consultation saves you thirty hours of frustration later. Most agents skip it because they want to start showing houses — and then spend thirty hours paying for that decision."

## Why This Rank
Buyer consultation prep is practical but has a lower hook ceiling than listing appointment scripts; solid deep-catalog content.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Every buyer problem you've ever dealt with — the ghosting, the cold feet, the unrealistic expectations — it started in the first conversation you never fully had. [ON-SCREEN: "It started in the first conversation you never fully had"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the pattern. Most agents rush or skip the buyer consultation because they want to get to the showing. But without that conversation, buyers don't understand the process, don't have realistic expectations about the market, and don't see your value — until it's too late.
Three months in, the deal falls apart. And they're not sure why. But you are. [ON-SCREEN: "Three months in, the deal falls apart — and you know why"]
Here's the fix. Before any buyer consultation, give Claude their profile — first-time buyer, price range, timeline, the market they're shopping — and type: "Give me the ten most important questions I should ask this buyer, the five market realities they need to hear before we start looking, and two scenarios where buyers in their situation typically get frustrated." [ON-SCREEN: "Give me the 10 questions and 5 market realities they need to hear"]
Walk in with a real structure. Not a blank stare.
A great buyer consultation saves you thirty hours of frustration later. Claude helps you run one every single time.
Do you have a formal buyer consultation process — or do you wing it? Be honest in the comments. [ON-SCREEN: Do you have a formal buyer consultation — or do you wing it?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "three months in, the deal falls apart — and you know why" re-hook lands well. Pair with Script #67 (Buyer Education Series) in a buyer-focused week. The CTA invites honest self-assessment and will generate quality comments.
