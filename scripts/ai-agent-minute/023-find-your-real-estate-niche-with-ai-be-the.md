## On-Screen Title
> Find Your Real Estate Niche With AI — Be The Obvious Choice For Someone

## Shareable Moment
> "When you try to serve everyone, you're memorable to no one. A niche doesn't shrink your market — it sharpens your message so the right people find you faster."

## Why This Rank
Niche clarity is the #1 brand problem for agents in competitive markets; the AI-assisted discovery angle is fresh.

## Full Script (Spoken)

"I work with all buyers and sellers in the greater metro area." That is the most forgettable sentence in real estate marketing. [ON-SCREEN: "The most forgettable sentence in real estate marketing"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why niching down feels scary and why you should do it anyway. Most agents avoid picking a niche because they think it means turning away business. It doesn't. It means becoming the obvious choice for a specific group of people — which actually generates more business, not less. When you're everything to everyone, you're memorable to no one.
Most agents try to attract everyone. The top producers attract exactly the right people — and those people send everyone they know. [ON-SCREEN: "Attract exactly the right people — and they send everyone they know"]
Here's how to find your niche. Ask Claude to run a discovery session with you. Type: "Help me identify my real estate niche by asking me these questions: What types of clients do I enjoy most? What neighborhoods or price ranges do I know best? What life transition do I understand deeply — divorce, downsizing, relocation, first-time buyers? What does my best client look like?" Give Claude your honest answers. Ask it to find the patterns. [ON-SCREEN: "What clients do I love? What do I know best? What's my story?"]
A niche doesn't shrink your market. It sharpens your message so the right people find you faster.
If you had to pick one type of client to specialize in — who would it be? Tell me below. [ON-SCREEN: If you had to specialize in one client type — who?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim the "what does my best client look like" question if needed. The CTA is highly specific and will generate clear, shareable answers. Strong candidate for a personal brand week anchor.
