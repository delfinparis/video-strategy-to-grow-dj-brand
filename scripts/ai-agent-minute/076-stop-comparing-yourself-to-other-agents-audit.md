# Stop Comparing Yourself To Other Agents — Audit Your Own Progress

## On-Screen Title
> Stop Comparing Yourself To Other Agents — Audit Your Own Trajectory Instead

## Shareable Moment
> "You're measuring your behind-the-scenes against their highlight reel. That comparison isn't just demoralizing — it's pulling your attention away from your own business."

## Why This Rank
Comparison trap content resonates deeply on social media; AI-auditing your own trajectory is a novel reframe.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You looked at another agent's Instagram today and felt bad about yourself. I know — because every agent does it. [ON-SCREEN: "Every agent does it"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what that comparison is actually costing you. You see someone post their record-breaking month, their luxury listing, their team milestone — and you measure your behind-the-scenes against their highlight reel. That's not just demoralizing. It pulls your focus off your own business at the exact moment you need to be building it.
And the agents who scroll the most tend to produce the least. That's not a coincidence. [ON-SCREEN: "The agents who scroll the most tend to produce the least"]
Here's the antidote. When comparison spiraling hits, open Claude and do a trajectory audit. Share your stats from twelve months ago versus today — deals, income, database size, skills you've added. Then type: "Write me a progress narrative — a paragraph that shows how far I've actually come, grounded in these real numbers." [ON-SCREEN: "Write my progress narrative — grounded in real numbers"]
Read that instead of scrolling. The only timeline that actually matters is yours.
What's one metric in your business that's genuinely better than it was a year ago? Drop it below — I want to hear it. [ON-SCREEN: What's one thing that's better than a year ago?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The CTA here is unusually good — asking "what's better" rather than asking about a problem generates positive, shareable comments. High likelihood of viral comment thread with agents encouraging each other. Consider a follow-up video responding to the best answers.
