## On-Screen Title
> Revive Dead Leads With AI — Your Next Deal Is Already In Your CRM

## Shareable Moment
> "Your next deal is probably already sitting in your database. You just stopped showing up."

## Why This Rank
Solid but competes with #58 (ghosted leads); space at least three weeks apart in the release schedule.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You have hundreds of dead leads in your CRM right now — and most of them aren't dead. You just ran out of things to say. [ON-SCREEN: "Most of them aren't dead. You just ran out of things to say."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's actually happening. The average agent follows up three times, gets silence, and marks the lead cold. But research consistently shows most buyers need seven or more touchpoints before they act. You're quitting at three — and handing those leads to the agent who doesn't.
And here's the part that stings — you're not even running out of time. You're running out of things to say. [ON-SCREEN: "You're not running out of time. You're running out of things to say."]
Here's the fix. Give Claude a lead's basic info — area of interest, price range, when they first reached out — and type: "Write a six-touch, six-month re-engagement sequence. Each message provides real value: a neighborhood update, a market insight, a useful tip. No message should ask if they're still looking." [ON-SCREEN: Paste this prompt + lead info into Claude]
Every touch should make them think: this agent actually pays attention.
Your next deal is probably already in your database. You just stopped showing up. Go find five dead leads tonight and run this on them. [ON-SCREEN: "Your next deal is already in your CRM"]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Slightly over word count — trim the second agitation line if needed on delivery. Verify the "seven or more touchpoints" stat before filming; widely cited but sourcing varies. The "save this and do it tonight" implicit CTA is stronger than asking a question here.
