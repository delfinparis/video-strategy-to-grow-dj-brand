## On-Screen Title
> Set Goals That Stick With AI — Reverse-Engineer The Math — Hit Your Number

## Shareable Moment
> "A goal without a daily activity attached to it isn't a goal. It's a wish. And wishes don't close deals."

## Why This Rank
Goal-setting is annual content that stays evergreen; the reverse-engineering angle is more actionable than standard goal posts.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You set a goal at the beginning of the year. By March, you forgot you set it. If that's ever happened to you — this is exactly why. [ON-SCREEN: "By March, you forgot you set it"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the real problem with how most agents set goals. They say "I want to do fifty deals this year" and then wait for the market to cooperate. But fifty deals isn't a goal — it's a wish. A real goal has a daily action attached to it. Without that, you're not planning. You're hoping.
And hope is not a production strategy. [ON-SCREEN: "Hope is not a production strategy"]
Here's how to turn a wish into a math equation. Tell Claude your income goal for the year and your average commission. Then type: "Calculate exactly how many closed deals, active clients, appointments, and prospecting calls I need per month, per week, and per day to hit this number. Then build me a simple weekly scorecard I can fill out every Friday to see if I'm on pace." [ON-SCREEN: "Daily calls → weekly appointments → monthly deals → annual goal"]
Now your goal isn't on a whiteboard. It's in your calendar. Every day.
A goal without a daily activity attached to it is just an expensive disappointment. Build yours with AI this week.
What's your deal goal for this year? Drop the number below — let's make it real. [ON-SCREEN: What's your deal goal for this year?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Hope is not a production strategy" is punchy and quotable — consider making it the on-screen callout. "Drop the number below" CTA is highly specific and will generate clean, countable engagement. Pairs with Scripts #20 and #79 as a planning trilogy.
