## On-Screen Title
> Decide When To Hire With AI — Stop Billing Yourself At $15 An Hour

## Shareable Moment
> "Your first hire isn't a cost. It's the investment that turns you from an agent into a business owner."

## Why This Rank
The hire-or-not decision is one of the most paralyzing inflection points in an agent's career; AI-based math cuts through the fear.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You're doing tasks every day that someone else could do for fifteen dollars an hour. Which means you're billing yourself at fifteen dollars an hour for time that should be worth two hundred. [ON-SCREEN: "Billing yourself at $15/hr for $200/hr time"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why most agents hire at the wrong time. They wait until they're drowning — and then they make every mistake of a desperate hire: wrong person, unclear role, no onboarding, no systems. The right time to hire isn't when you're overwhelmed. It's when the math tells you to.
Most agents hire out of desperation. Top producers hire out of data. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents hire out of desperation. Top producers hire out of data."]
Here's how to get the data. List every task you did last week and how long each one took. Give that list to Claude and type: "Sort these into tasks that require my expertise versus tasks a part-time assistant could handle. Estimate the cost of hiring someone to do the second category — and the opportunity cost of me continuing to do them myself." [ON-SCREEN: "What's the cost of me doing this vs. hiring someone?"]
The math will tell you if it's time.
Your first hire isn't a cost. It's the investment that turns you from an agent into a business owner.
What's the task you most wish you could hand off to someone else right now? Drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: What do you most wish you could hand off?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "$15/hr vs $200/hr" hook is concrete, specific, and immediately provocative — strong scroll-stop potential. The "hire out of desperation vs. data" contrast line is clean and shareable. Top-15 candidate.
