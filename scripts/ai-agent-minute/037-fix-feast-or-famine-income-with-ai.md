## On-Screen Title
> Fix Feast-Or-Famine Income With AI — Build A Pipeline Floor — Get Paid Consistently

## Shareable Moment
> "The busy season creates the next slow season. That cycle doesn't break by accident — it breaks by design."

## Why This Rank
Income inconsistency is the most stressful business problem for agents; the pipeline visibility angle is practical and calming.

## Full Script (Spoken)

In January you're broke. In June you're great. In September you're stressed again. This isn't bad luck — it's a pipeline problem you're creating yourself. [ON-SCREEN: "It's a pipeline problem you're creating yourself"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the cycle most agents are stuck in. When business is slow, you prospect hard. When business picks up, you stop prospecting because you're too busy. The busy season feels like success — but it's actually creating the next slow season. And then the panic hits again, and the cycle repeats.
Most agents live in this cycle for their entire career and never realize they're the ones causing it. [ON-SCREEN: "They never realize they're the ones causing it"]
Here's how to break it. Ask Claude to help you build a "pipeline floor" — the minimum prospecting activity you will do every single week, no matter how busy you are. Type: "If I want a floor of two closings every month, what is the minimum daily prospecting calls, weekly appointments, and monthly new lead adds I need to maintain consistently — starting today?" [ON-SCREEN: "What's my minimum prospecting floor to guarantee two closings a month?"]
Then ask Claude to build that activity as a non-negotiable block in your weekly schedule.
The busy season is exactly when you must protect your prospecting time. That's the only thing that ends the cycle.
Are you currently in a feast or a famine? Tell me where you're at. [ON-SCREEN: Feast or famine right now?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "you're the one creating it" agitation line will sting in the best way — it flips the victim narrative into an agency narrative. Runs slightly long — trim the "panic hits again" sentence if needed. Strong emotional arc throughout.
