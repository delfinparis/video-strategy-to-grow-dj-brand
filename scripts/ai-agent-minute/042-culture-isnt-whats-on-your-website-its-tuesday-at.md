## Full Script (Spoken)

Culture isn't what's on your website. It's what happens on your team on a Tuesday afternoon when no deal is closing and the mood is low. [ON-SCREEN: Culture = what you do on a Tuesday. Not what you say on your website.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Most team leaders talk about their culture in recruiting conversations — and they genuinely believe what they're saying. The problem is it was never defined. Culture by default is whoever's having the worst day. An agent who's struggling sets the tone. A conflict goes unresolved because there's no defined process for resolving it. New agents don't know what's expected of them. Veterans don't know what's celebrated. And eventually people start calling "team" a word that means nothing. [ON-SCREEN: Undefined culture = whoever's having the worst day sets the tone.]
And here's what it costs you — top agents choose teams based on culture as much as commission. They're talking to each other. Word travels.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you write a real team culture document — not a mission statement, a working document. It should define: the specific behaviors you celebrate and reward, the behaviors that aren't acceptable and what happens when they occur, how conflicts get resolved, how decisions get made, what communication norms look like on your team, and what it actually means to succeed here. Share it with every current and prospective team member. When culture is written down, it becomes a real thing instead of an intention. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Help me write a team culture document defining celebrated behaviors, unacceptable behaviors, conflict resolution, decision-making, and success metrics."]
A defined culture document is a recruiting tool, a retention tool, and an accountability tool — all in one afternoon with Claude.
Does your team have a written culture document? Yes, in progress, or never done it — tell me where you are. [ON-SCREEN: Written culture doc: yes / in progress / never done it]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
The hook is one of the most quotable lines in the batch — high share potential beyond real estate into general business audiences. Consider this as a crossover post for LinkedIn. No accuracy concerns.
