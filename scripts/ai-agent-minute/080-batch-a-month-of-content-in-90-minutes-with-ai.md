# Batch A Month Of Content In 90 Minutes With AI

**Category:** Time & Productivity | **Avatar:** All | **AI Tool:** Claude

## On-Screen Title
> Batch A Month Of Content In 90 Minutes — Not Daily — Stay Consistent

## Shareable Moment
> "Consistency beats creativity. And AI makes it possible to be both — but only if you stop doing it the hard way."

## Why This Rank
Batching content is valuable but competes with #78 (rainy day fund) and #51 (repurposing); space them across themes.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The reason most agents quit social media after three weeks is they're creating content one post at a time. That's entirely the wrong approach. [ON-SCREEN: "Creating one post at a time is the wrong approach"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the painful loop most agents are stuck in. You sit down to figure out what to post today, spend twenty minutes staring at a blank screen, produce something mediocre, hate the whole process, skip tomorrow, skip the day after, and three weeks later you've abandoned another attempt at consistency.
That loop isn't a willpower problem. It's a workflow problem. [ON-SCREEN: "It's not a willpower problem. It's a workflow problem."]
Here's the fix. Once a month, sit down with Claude for ninety minutes. Type: "I'm a real estate agent. My five content themes are [list them]. My audience is buyers and sellers in [your market]. Generate thirty post ideas with a hook, body copy, and a CTA for each." Pick your twenty favorites. Refine them in the same session. Schedule them out. [ON-SCREEN: "Generate 30 posts with hook, body copy, and CTA"]
You just handled an entire month of social media. In one sitting.
Most agents post when inspired. The top producers post on a schedule. AI makes that possible without burning out.
How many days a week are you posting right now? Drop your number. [ON-SCREEN: How many days a week are you posting?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "loop" description in the problem section (stare → mediocre → hate → skip → abandon) is a perfect mirror moment — every agent will recognize it. Mild overlap with Script #26 (content calendar strategy) — keep this on the batching mechanic, Script #26 on strategic planning.
