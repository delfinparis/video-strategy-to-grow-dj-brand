## On-Screen Title
> Build A Math-Based Weekly Schedule With AI — Not Habit — Hit Your Goals

## Shareable Moment
> "Busyness is not a strategy. A schedule built around your actual production numbers is. AI builds that schedule in fifteen minutes."

## Why This Rank
Time-blocking by math rather than habit is smart; lower hook ceiling than shutdown ritual and inbox scripts.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You don't have a time management problem. You have a schedule design problem. There's a real difference — and most agents never figure it out. [ON-SCREEN: "You have a schedule design problem — not a time problem"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what most agents' days look like. They have a vague sense of what they should be doing but no actual structure. So they do whatever feels most urgent. Which is almost never the most important thing. Weeks go by. No new listings. No new buyer consultations. A lot of motion — with nothing to show for it.
And the agents who do hit their goals? They have a schedule. Not a to-do list. A real, time-blocked schedule built around actual numbers. [ON-SCREEN: "A schedule built around actual numbers — not feelings"]
Here's how to build one. Tell Claude your annual income goal, your average commission, and your current lead-to-close conversion rate. Then type: "Work backward and calculate exactly how many prospecting hours, appointments, and follow-up blocks I need every week to hit this goal. Then build a time-blocked weekly schedule around those numbers." [ON-SCREEN: "Calculate what I need weekly — then build the schedule"]
You now have a schedule designed by math. Not habit. Not guilt.
Busyness is not a strategy. Build yours tonight — and tell me what the math tells you. [ON-SCREEN: What does the math say you need to do each week?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Not habit. Not guilt." is a small addition that lands with weight — keep it. The CTA asking "what does the math tell you" is stronger than the original because it drives action before commenting. No accuracy issues.
