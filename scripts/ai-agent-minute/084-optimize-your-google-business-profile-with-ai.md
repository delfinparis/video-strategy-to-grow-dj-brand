## Why This Rank
Google Business Profile is an overlooked SEO asset; the optimization angle is practical and credible.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Right now, someone in your market is Googling "real estate agent near me." The question is whether they're finding you — or your competitor. [ON-SCREEN: "Are they finding you — or your competitor?"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what most agents don't realize. Your Google Business profile is often the very first impression a potential client has of you — before your website, before your social media, before any conversation. And most agent profiles are either incomplete, haven't been updated in years, or have no posts and no review responses. You're invisible to the people who are literally searching for you right now.
Most agents spend money on paid ads to get found. Google Business gets you found for free — if you actually optimize it. [ON-SCREEN: "Gets you found for free — if you actually optimize it"]
Here's the fix. Ask Claude: "Give me a complete checklist for an optimized real estate agent Google Business profile — including photo types, service categories, post frequency, and review response best practices." Complete that checklist in one afternoon. Then ask Claude to write your first five profile posts and a review response template for every star rating. [ON-SCREEN: "Complete checklist → first 5 posts → review response templates"]
Google Business is free, local, and high-intent. It's the highest-ROI marketing move most agents are completely ignoring.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Free, local, high-intent" is a strong three-word summary worth putting on screen. The opening hook works well as a present-tense scenario. Strong practical value — this tip is underutilized enough to feel novel even to experienced agents.
