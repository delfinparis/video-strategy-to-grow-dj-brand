# Write Your Monthly Newsletter With AI — Not Skip It

## On-Screen Title
> Write Your Monthly Newsletter With AI — Not Skip It — Stay Top Of Mind With Your Entire Database

## Shareable Moment
> "The agent who shows up in the inbox every month is the agent who gets the call. AI makes it possible to show up every single month without burning out."

## Why This Rank
Newsletter consistency is the #1 dropped ball in agent marketing; 'not skip it' addresses the exact failure mode.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your email list is one of the most valuable assets in your entire business — and most agents send it one email a year at Christmas. [ON-SCREEN: "One email a year — at Christmas"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening to your database right now. Your past clients and sphere are getting emails from other agents, other brands, and other services every single week. You're not sending anything. So when their neighbor asks for a real estate referral — you're not the first name that comes to mind. Not because you didn't do great work. Because you've been invisible for eleven months.
The agent who's in the inbox consistently is the agent who's top of mind when it matters. [ON-SCREEN: "In the inbox consistently = top of mind when it matters"]
Here's how to make it take twenty minutes a month. Give Claude: one local market data point, one practical seasonal home tip, one personal story or observation from your business, and a recent listing or testimonial. Then type: "Weave these into a five-paragraph email that feels like it came from a person — conversational, warm, and something I'd actually enjoy reading. Not corporate. Not a newsletter template." [ON-SCREEN: "1 market point + 1 home tip + 1 personal story + listing = 5-paragraph email"]
Write it in your voice. Send it from your personal email. Sign it with your name. Consistency over perfection — every single time.
Do you send a monthly email to your database? Yes, sometimes, or never — drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: Monthly email — yes, sometimes, or never?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Invisible for eleven months" is the sharpest addition in this script — highly specific and accurate. Runs slightly long — trim on delivery. Watch overlap with Script #45 (monthly market updates) — this is about the full database newsletter, #45 is about market education specifically. Space these 3+ weeks apart.
