## Why This Rank
Sixty-second prep is a specific, believable, immediately actionable promise that drives saves.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your buyer is about to walk into a house. Do you know anything about it besides what's on the MLS sheet? [ON-SCREEN: "Anything besides the MLS sheet?"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening at most showings. You have the same information as your buyer — because it all came from the same place. You're supposed to be the expert in the room, but you don't know the neighborhood's recent price trajectory, what sold two streets over in the last sixty days, or the two smart questions worth asking the listing agent. Your buyer looks to you for context. You're reading the brochure.
Most agents show up to showings with the MLS information. Top producers show up with context. [ON-SCREEN: "MLS information vs. context"]
Here's the sixty-second prep. Before any showing, give Claude the property address and type: "Pull: comparable sales within a quarter mile in the last ninety days with price per square foot, the price trend for this neighborhood over the last twelve months, any public records worth knowing about this property, and two smart questions I should ask the listing agent." [ON-SCREEN: "Comps + price trend + public records + 2 questions for listing agent"]
You walk in with context. Your buyer sees an expert who did their homework. That trust is hard to break once you've built it.
The most prepared agent in the room wins the most loyal clients. Sixty seconds with AI makes you that agent every time.
What's the first thing you currently do to prepare for a showing? Tell me your process. [ON-SCREEN: What's your current showing prep process?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Reading the brochure" is a precise and slightly embarrassing mirror moment — keep it. Runs slightly long — trim on delivery if needed. The "sixty seconds" hook is specific enough to be credible and low-barrier.
