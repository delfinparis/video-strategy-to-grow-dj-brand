## On-Screen Title
> Build A Pre-Foreclosure Outreach System With AI — Find Deals Before Everyone Else — Help Homeowners In Crisis

## Shareable Moment
> "Pre-foreclosure outreach done right isn't predatory — it's one of the most genuinely helpful things an agent can do for a homeowner who doesn't know their options."

## Why This Rank
Pre-foreclosure is a compassionate lead source with real urgency; AI makes the research and outreach scalable.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The best deals in real estate are almost never on the MLS. They're found by agents who do homework the competition refuses to do. [ON-SCREEN: "Homework the competition refuses to do"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the reality most agents don't know. Pre-foreclosure properties are documented in public county records — available to anyone who looks. The homeowners in those records are often in genuine distress, and many of them have no idea what options they actually have. They might not know a short sale is possible. They might not know they could sell in time to preserve their credit. The agent who reaches out with empathy and information before the bank does something irreversible is doing real, meaningful work.
Most agents ignore this lead source because they don't know how to approach it correctly. [ON-SCREEN: "Don't know how to approach it correctly"]
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to build a compassionate pre-foreclosure outreach system. Type: "Write a homeowner outreach system for someone in pre-foreclosure. Include: a letter that leads with empathy and options — not a pitch, a list of what I can genuinely offer them — short sale expertise, cash buyer network, flexible timeline, and a follow-up sequence for homeowners who need time to process." [ON-SCREEN: "Lead with empathy and options — not a pitch"]
Done right, this isn't predatory. It's genuinely one of the most helpful things an agent can do for a homeowner in crisis.

## Producer Note
The "compassionate" reframe is what makes this script work — it's a legitimate lead source that most agents avoid because it feels opportunistic, and the script directly addresses that. Narrower audience but high resonance for aspiring top producers. No accuracy issues.
