## On-Screen Title
> Build A SOI Touchpoint Calendar With AI — Not Contact People Randomly — Generate Referrals On Schedule

## Shareable Moment
> "You don't stay top of mind by accident. You stay top of mind by design. AI helps you build the design."

## Why This Rank
SOI is the highest-ROI lead source; a systematic touchpoint calendar is the difference between intention and execution.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Referrals don't happen randomly. They happen when you're top of mind at the exact moment someone in your sphere needs an agent. And that requires a system — not good intentions. [ON-SCREEN: "Requires a system — not good intentions"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what "staying in touch" actually looks like for most agents. They think about calling someone, don't call, feel guilty, avoid thinking about it again. Or they text on birthdays, which means their most valuable relationships get one contact a year. Meanwhile, another agent has been showing up in that person's inbox, their feed, and their mailbox every single month. And when that person's friend asks for a realtor recommendation — they give the other agent's name.
The agents with referral-based businesses don't have better relationships. They have better systems for maintaining them. [ON-SCREEN: "Better systems — not better relationships"]
Here's the system. Categorize your top one hundred contacts into three tiers — A for most likely to refer, B for possible, C for occasional. Give Claude the tiers and type: "Build a twelve-month touchpoint calendar for each tier: frequency, contact type — call, text, handwritten note, email, pop-by — and what message theme fits each time of year. Make the A-tier feel truly personalized and frequent." [ON-SCREEN: "Tier A, B, C → frequency + type + message theme for each month"]
You now have a scheduled referral generation system. Not hope. A system.
How often do you currently contact the top twenty people in your database? Drop your honest number. [ON-SCREEN: How often do you contact your top 20?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Thinks about calling, doesn't call, feels guilty, avoids it" is a precise and painfully accurate mirror moment — keep it exactly as written. Runs slightly long — trim on delivery. The tiered A/B/C system is a simple concept that agents will act on immediately.
