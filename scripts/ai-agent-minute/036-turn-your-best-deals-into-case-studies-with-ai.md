## On-Screen Title
> Turn Your Best Deals Into Case Studies With AI — Not Let Them Disappear — Win Future Clients With Proof

## Shareable Moment
> "Your track record is your best marketing asset. Most agents let it disappear into memory instead of turning it into proof that works forever."

## Why This Rank
Case studies are the most underused marketing asset in real estate; this script shows agents how to mine their own history.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Every difficult deal you close is a story that could win you the next ten clients. Most agents let those stories disappear completely. [ON-SCREEN: "Let those stories disappear completely"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening to your most valuable professional experiences. Multiple-offer battles, deals that nearly fell apart, creative financing solutions, distressed properties where you held everything together — these are your best evidence of real-world competence. But because you never documented them, they exist only in your memory. You can't show them to a seller at a listing appointment. You can't put them on your website. You can't post them to social media. They're invisible.
Most agents have an impressive track record that no one knows about. [ON-SCREEN: "Impressive track record that no one knows about"]
Here's how to fix that. After any complex or successful deal, spend ten minutes talking into your phone: the situation, the challenge, what you did, what the outcome was for the client. Then paste that into Claude and type: "Turn this into a professional case study: one paragraph each for the challenge, my approach, and the result. Add a placeholder for a client quote. Keep it under two hundred fifty words." [ON-SCREEN: "Challenge → approach → result → client quote → under 250 words"]
Collect ten of these. Use them in listing presentations. Put them on your website. Post them to social media. Real proof closes more deals than any marketing copy ever written.
What's the most complex deal you've ever closed? Tell me the story in the comments. [ON-SCREEN: What's your most complex deal? Tell me the story.]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "exists only in your memory" line is the core mirror moment — accurate and slightly painful for every experienced agent who's never documented their best work. The CTA will generate rich stories in the comments. Strong for aspiring top producers.
