## Shareable Moment
> "Fifteen minutes of focused reflection with AI is worth more than fifteen hours of unfocused effort. That math is why some agents grow every year and others plateau."

## Why This Rank
Weekly review is a high-discipline habit; narrower appeal than daily routine scripts but essential for systematizers.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You can't grow a business you're not measuring — and most agents aren't measuring anything. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents aren't measuring anything"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the pattern I've seen across hundreds of top-producing agents in twelve years of interviews. Every single one does a weekly business review. They look at their numbers — leads in, appointments set, offers written, deals closed — compare them to their targets, and adjust. The agents who don't do this? They often stay stuck at the exact same production level, year after year, wondering what they're missing.
What they're missing is the fifteen-minute habit that separates people who grow from people who plateau. [ON-SCREEN: "The 15-minute habit that separates growers from plateauers"]
Here's exactly what it looks like. Every Friday, give Claude your week's numbers and type: "Compare my actual activity against my weekly targets, identify my single biggest gap, and give me the one adjustment that would have the highest impact next week." [ON-SCREEN: "Compare actual vs. target → identify biggest gap → one adjustment"]
That's it. Fifteen minutes.
Fifteen minutes of focused reflection with AI is worth more than fifteen hours of unfocused effort. Start this Friday.
When's the last time you actually looked at your weekly production numbers? Be honest — drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last look at your weekly numbers?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The credibility signal ("hundreds of top producers in twelve years") is earned and naturally deployed. "Start this Friday" is the "you can do this today" close — keep it. Pairs with Scripts #30 and #79 as a planning-and-measurement trilogy.
