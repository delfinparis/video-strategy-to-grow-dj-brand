## On-Screen Title
> Re-Engage Ghosted Leads With AI — Stop Chasing — Give Them A Reason To Respond

## Shareable Moment
> "Leads don't ghost agents they find valuable. They ghost agents they feel pressure from. Those are completely different problems with completely different solutions."

## Why This Rank
Universal pain at the highest emotional intensity — ghosting feels personal, and the fix is immediately actionable.

## Full Script (Spoken)

A lead going quiet doesn't mean they're gone. It almost always means your last message gave them no reason to respond. [ON-SCREEN: "Your last message gave them no reason to respond"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what most agents do when a lead goes quiet. They send more of the same: "Just following up." "Wanted to check in." "Haven't heard from you." Every one of those messages communicates the same thing — you need this deal more than they need you. And clients ghost when they feel pressure. Not when they feel value.
Most agents chase ghosted leads. Top producers give them a reason to come back. [ON-SCREEN: "Chase them vs. give them a reason to come back"]
Here's the three-touch sequence that actually works. Give Claude the lead's original profile and type: "Write a three-touch re-engagement sequence built entirely on value — no asks. Touch one: a relevant market update for their target area. Touch two: a specific property that just came on the market matching what they told me they wanted. Touch three: a low-pressure check-in: 'I want to make sure I'm still being helpful — is your timing still the same?'" [ON-SCREEN: "Value → relevant listing → low-pressure check-in"]
Every message gives them a reason to respond. None of them makes them feel guilty for going quiet.
Leads don't ghost agents they find valuable. They ghost agents they feel pressure from. How many ghosted leads are sitting in your CRM right now? Drop a rough number below. [ON-SCREEN: How many ghosted leads are in your CRM right now?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Highest-scoring script in this batch — top-10 candidate for the full series. The contrast between "chasing" and "giving a reason to come back" is the clearest articulation of why follow-up fails. Runs slightly long — trim "Haven't heard from you" from the problem section. Film in week two or three.
