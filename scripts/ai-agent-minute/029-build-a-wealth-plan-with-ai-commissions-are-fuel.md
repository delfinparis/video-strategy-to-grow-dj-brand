## On-Screen Title
> Build A Wealth Plan With AI — Commissions Are Fuel — Invest The Difference

## Shareable Moment
> "You can be a top producer and broke. It happens more than people talk about — and it happens because closing deals and building wealth are two completely different skills."

## Why This Rank
Most agents never think beyond the next commission check; this script reframes GCI as a means, not an end.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You can be a top producer and completely broke. It happens more than anyone in this industry talks about — and I've seen it firsthand with agents I've interviewed. [ON-SCREEN: "Top producer. Completely broke. It happens."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why. Real estate income is inconsistent. Being self-employed means no pension, no 401k match, no automatic tax withholding. Most agents spend what they earn, under-save for taxes, and arrive at retirement with less wealth than their clients who worked a nine-to-five their whole lives. After thirty years in the business they love.
Closing deals and building wealth are two completely different skills. Most agents only learn one. [ON-SCREEN: "Closing deals and building wealth are different skills. Most only learn one."]
Here's the fix. Sit down with Claude for a wealth planning session. Give it your average annual income, your current savings rate, your age, and your retirement goal. Type: "Outline the minimum I should set aside for taxes each month, a basic investment framework for self-employed agents, and one or two strategies high-producing agents use to convert commission income into lasting wealth." [ON-SCREEN: "Taxes → investment framework → converting commissions to wealth"]
Your commissions are fuel. Wealth is the vehicle. Most agents never build the vehicle.
Are you investing any of your commissions right now — or spending all of it? Be honest below. [ON-SCREEN: Are you investing commissions — or spending all of it?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "I've seen it firsthand with agents I've interviewed" credibility signal is natural and powerful — keep it. Note: Claude is not a financial advisor — add a brief "this is general direction, not financial advice" either in-video or in the caption. The CTA invites a vulnerable honest answer that will generate real engagement.
