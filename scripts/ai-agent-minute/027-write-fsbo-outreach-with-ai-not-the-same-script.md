## Shareable Moment

## Why This Rank
FSBO is a perennially underworked lead source; the 'not the same script everyone sends' angle is the exact objection most agents have.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Every FSBO in your market is getting the same three calls from agents this week. Don't be the fourth version of the same conversation. [ON-SCREEN: "Don't be the fourth version of the same call"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why FSBO outreach fails. Most agents lead with the commission objection — they try to prove the FSBO needs them before the FSBO has decided they trust them. But the FSBO's first concern isn't the commission. It's whether they can actually pull this off themselves. And the agent who helps them try — genuinely helps, not helps-to-fail — is the one who earns the listing when they give up.
Most agents pitch FSBOs. Top producers help them first and earn the listing later. [ON-SCREEN: "Help first. Earn the listing later."]
Here's the system. Ask Claude to build a three-touch FSBO sequence using the "consultation-first" model. Touch one: offer something genuinely useful — a free market analysis, a staging checklist, or a document guide for FSBO sellers. No pitch. No "let me show you why you need me." Just value. Touches two and three build on that. Type: "Write an outreach sequence for a FSBO seller where I never ask for the listing until the third message — and every touch earns the right to send the next one." [ON-SCREEN: "No ask until touch three — earn each message"]
The FSBO who eventually lists with an agent almost always lists with the one who helped them most before asking for anything.
Have you ever converted a FSBO? Tell me how you did it — or how you tried. [ON-SCREEN: Have you ever converted a FSBO?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim "helps-to-fail" beat on delivery. The "help first, earn the listing later" contrast is the clearest articulation of why FSBO outreach works or doesn't. CTA will surface good stories.
