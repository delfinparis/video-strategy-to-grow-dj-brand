## On-Screen Title
> Counter Discount Broker Objections With AI — Win On Results Not Price

## Shareable Moment
> "The agents who lose to discount brokers talk about price. The agents who win talk about results. Those are two completely different conversations."

## Why This Rank
Discount broker pressure is real and growing; agents need language and Claude provides it.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your prospect just said "We're thinking of using Redfin — it's cheaper." Here's what most agents say wrong. [ON-SCREEN: "Here's what most agents say wrong"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
The moment you get defensive about your fee, you've already lost. You've framed this as a price debate — and in a price debate, cheaper wins. You should never have to defend your commission. You should make the value of full representation so clear that the price comparison becomes irrelevant.
Most agents defend what they charge. Top producers demonstrate what they deliver. [ON-SCREEN: "Defend what you charge vs. demonstrate what you deliver"]
Here's how to build that demonstration. Use Perplexity to pull data on discount versus full-service agents in your market — list-to-sale price ratios, average days on market, buyer satisfaction scores. Then bring that into Claude and type: "Write me a two-minute response to the Redfin objection that's entirely data-driven, never defensive, and always focused on the client's outcome — not my commission." [ON-SCREEN: "Data-driven. Never defensive. Always about their outcome."]
Practice it until you can deliver it without a single note.
The agents who lose to discount brokers talk about price. The agents who win talk about results.
Have you ever lost a client to a discount brokerage? Tell me what they said. [ON-SCREEN: Have you ever lost a client to a discount broker?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "defend vs. demonstrate" contrast line is the sharpest in this script — make it the on-screen callout. Market data availability via Perplexity will vary by location — caveat that agents should verify what's available in their specific market before filming. Pairs with Scripts #11 and #42 for a "defending your value" mini-series.
