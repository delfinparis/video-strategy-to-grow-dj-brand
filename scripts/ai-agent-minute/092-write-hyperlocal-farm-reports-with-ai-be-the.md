> Write Hyperlocal Farm Reports With AI — Be The Mailer They Keep

## Shareable Moment
> "Geographic farming works when you're genuinely useful. AI gets you there without hiring a marketing team."

## Why This Rank
Farming is a long-game strategy; strong for agents committed to geographic farming but lower urgency for the broader audience.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your farm mailers look exactly like every other agent's — and that's exactly why they go straight in the trash. [ON-SCREEN: "That's exactly why they go straight in the trash"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's really happening. Every homeowner in your farm is getting three mailers a month from different agents — all the same postcard design, all the same generic market stats, all the same stock photo of a smiling family. Nobody keeps any of them. None of them prove that agent has ever walked down that street.
Most agents farm a neighborhood. The top producers become the neighborhood. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents farm a neighborhood. Top producers become it."]
Here's how. Use Perplexity to pull hyperlocal data on your farm — recent sales, days on market, price-per-square-foot trends, any upcoming development in the area. Then bring that into Claude and type: "Write a one-page neighborhood market report in a conversational tone. Make it feel like the agent writing this actually lives down the street — not like a corporate flyer." [ON-SCREEN: "Make it feel like the agent lives down the street"]
That's the mailer they put on the refrigerator.
Geographic farming works when you're genuinely useful. AI gets you there without a marketing team. What neighborhood are you farming right now? Drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: What neighborhood are you farming?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "farm a neighborhood vs. become the neighborhood" contrast line is the best addition here — consider making it the on-screen title callout. Watch overlap with Script #54 (hyperlocal digital content) — keep this focused on physical mailers, #54 on social media.
