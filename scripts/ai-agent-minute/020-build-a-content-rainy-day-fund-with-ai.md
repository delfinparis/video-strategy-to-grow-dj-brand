## On-Screen Title
> Build A Content Rainy Day Fund With AI — Never Go Silent — Stay Visible Even When You're Not Inspired

## Shareable Moment
> "Inspiration is optional. Systems are not. AI builds the system that shows up even when you don't feel like it."

## Why This Rank
The 'never go dark' framing creates urgency; batching content strategy is actionable in a single afternoon.

## Full Script (Spoken)

"I don't know what to post today." That thought has silenced more agent social media accounts than any algorithm ever has. [ON-SCREEN: "Silenced more accounts than any algorithm ever has"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the loop most agents are trapped in. They post consistently for two weeks, run out of ideas, skip three days, feel guilty, skip a week, and then tell themselves they'll "restart on Monday." Monday comes and goes. The gap compounds. Followers disengage. And six months later they're starting over from scratch — again. This isn't a discipline problem. It's a content infrastructure problem. You built a posting habit without building a content reserve to support it.
Most agents try to post from inspiration. Top producers post from inventory. [ON-SCREEN: "Post from inspiration vs. post from inventory"]
Here's the fix. Spend one hour with Claude building a "content rainy day fund." Type: "Generate thirty pieces of evergreen real estate content that don't require timely data or personal stories. Include: real estate myth-busting posts, client FAQ answers, 'did you know' market facts, process explainers, and seasonal home tips. Write them all ready to post." Save them in a Google Doc. [ON-SCREEN: "30 evergreen posts — ready to post, no timely data needed"]
On the days you have nothing to say — pull from the fund. You never go silent again.
Inspiration is optional. Systems are not. AI builds the system that shows up even when you don't feel like it.
How long was your longest social media silence this year? Drop the number of days honestly. [ON-SCREEN: How long was your longest social media gap this year?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "restart on Monday" loop description is the highest-scoring mirror moment in this batch — essentially every agent who's ever tried social media will recognize this exact cycle. Top-10 candidate for the full series. The CTA asking for a number of days creates low-stakes, honest participation. Film in the first half of the series.
