## On-Screen Title
> End Your Day With An AI Shutdown Ritual — Close The Loops — Sleep Better

## Shareable Moment
> "How you end today determines how you start tomorrow. Ten minutes with AI gives you back your evenings — and your mornings."

## Why This Rank
Completely unique angle no other creator is doing; 'shutdown ritual' is a concrete, ownable concept that will be screenshot and saved.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The most productive agents I've ever interviewed don't work harder than you. They stop better. [ON-SCREEN: "They don't work harder than you. They stop better."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the real problem. Most agents finish the day by stopping — not by closing. There's no shutdown ritual. You go from showing houses to making dinner with thirty open loops running in your head: the follow-up you didn't send, the offer you need to prep, the email you meant to write. That mental load is why you can't sleep. And why you start the next day already behind.
You're not just carrying work home. You're carrying the feeling that you're always behind. [ON-SCREEN: "You're carrying the feeling that you're always behind"]
Here's the fix. Build a ten-minute end-of-day ritual with Claude as your debrief partner. Each evening, tell Claude what you got done, what's still open, and what tomorrow needs. Then type: "Sort my open items by priority, tell me what can wait or be delegated, and write my top three tasks for tomorrow morning." [ON-SCREEN: "Sort open items → what can wait → top 3 for tomorrow"]
Then close the laptop. The loops are closed. Your brain can actually rest.
How you end today determines how you start tomorrow. Ten minutes with AI gives you back your evenings.
Do you have an end-of-day shutdown ritual — or do you just stop? Tell me below. [ON-SCREEN: Do you have a shutdown ritual — or do you just stop?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"They stop better" is the best hook in the productivity category — unexpected and immediately intriguing. The addition of "you're not just carrying work home, you're carrying the feeling that you're always behind" is the mirror moment that will make agents pause. Top-5 candidate. Film in week one.
