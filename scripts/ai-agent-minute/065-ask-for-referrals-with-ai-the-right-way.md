## Why This Rank
Referral asks feel awkward; Claude gives agents language that's natural rather than transactional.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You have dozens of happy past clients who would refer you in a heartbeat — if you just asked the right way. [ON-SCREEN: "They'd refer you — if you asked the right way"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why most referral asks fail. Either agents never make them — or they ask in a way that feels transactional: "Do you know anyone looking to buy or sell?" That lands like a sales pitch. The client feels put on the spot, says "I'll keep you in mind," and forgets about it by the time they park the car.
The problem isn't asking. It's asking with no context, no specificity, and no story about who you're trying to help. [ON-SCREEN: "No context. No specificity. No story about who you're trying to help."]
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to write five different referral request messages for different moments: right after closing, the six-month check-in, the one-year anniversary, a casual text version, and a social media post the client could actually share. Each one should type: "Be specific about who I'm trying to help, make it easy for the client to take action, and feel personal — not like a mass message." [ON-SCREEN: "Specific. Easy to act on. Personal — not mass."]
Load them into your CRM. Actually send them.
Asking for a referral isn't awkward. Not asking when your client would be happy to help you — that's the real waste.
When's the last time you explicitly asked a past client for a referral? Tell me below. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last ask a past client for a referral?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim the "by the time they park the car" line if needed. The five-version referral system is highly actionable and specific. The "load them in your CRM, actually send them" close is blunt and effective — very D.J.
