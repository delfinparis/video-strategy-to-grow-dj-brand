# Most Agents Use AI Like Google. The Top 1% Don't.

## On-Screen Title
> Most Agents Use AI Like Google. The Top 1% Don't.

## Shareable Moment
> "Most agents use AI to get one answer and move on. The top producers have made it a daily thinking partner — and the gap in results after twelve months is enormous."

## Why This Rank
The meta-premise of the entire series in one script; best posted as episode 2 to anchor the audience's reason to keep watching.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Most agents use AI the way they use Google — one question, one answer, move on. That's the smallest version of what it can actually do for your business. [ON-SCREEN: You're using AI like Google. Top producers don't.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the difference I've seen across hundreds of conversations with high producers. The agents getting the most from AI aren't using it occasionally for a specific task. They've made it a daily thinking partner — for morning planning, for call debriefs, for strategy, for skill practice, for problem-solving when they're stuck. The agents who use it occasionally treat it like a faster search engine. The agents who use it daily treat it like a colleague who never gets tired, never judges them, and always has time to think through the problem. [ON-SCREEN: Occasional AI user vs. daily thinking partner = entirely different results]
And here's the part that should make you move on this — the gap between these two groups compounds. Every month you don't change how you use AI is a month the other group gets further ahead.
Here's the shift. Instead of asking AI one question at a time, start treating your Claude session like a daily meeting. Morning: "Here's my plan — what am I missing and what's the biggest risk?" After a call: "Here's what happened — what should I do differently and how do I follow up?" When you're stuck: "Here's the problem — help me think through it from three angles." Before bed: "Here's what I got done and what's still open — set me up for tomorrow." That's it. Same Claude. Completely different results. [ON-SCREEN: Morning check-in → Post-call debrief → Problem-solve → End-of-day setup]
AI doesn't compound on its own. Your use of it does. Start today.

"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Top-5 film-first candidate — this is the "meta" script that reframes the entire series premise. The four daily use cases (morning / post-call / stuck / end of day) are highly screenable and saveable. Extremely high share potential. Consider making this one of the first five to post.
