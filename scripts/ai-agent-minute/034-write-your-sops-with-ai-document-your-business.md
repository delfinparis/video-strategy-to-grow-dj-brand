## Why This Rank
SOPs are the unsexy infrastructure that separates scalable businesses from single-agent chaos.

## Full Script (Spoken)

If your business only works because of what's in your head — you don't have a business. You have a job. [ON-SCREEN: "You don't have a business. You have a job."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what this looks like in practice. You do everything from memory — how you onboard a new client, how you run a listing appointment, how you coordinate a transaction. As long as nothing changes, it works. But the moment you try to hire help, delegate anything, or take a real vacation — everything falls apart. Because none of it is written down anywhere.
And you can't sell, scale, or step away from a business that only lives in your brain. [ON-SCREEN: "You can't scale what only lives in your brain"]
Here's the fix — and it's easier than you think. Pick one process. Your listing appointment workflow. Do a voice brain dump into your phone: everything you do, in order, from confirming the appointment to after you leave the house. Then paste it into Claude and type: "Turn this into a clean step-by-step SOP with a checklist I can hand to an assistant or follow myself." [ON-SCREEN: "Turn this into a step-by-step SOP with a checklist"]
Do one process a week. In ten weeks, you have a documented business.
Written systems make your business sellable, scalable, and survivable. AI makes building them take thirty minutes.
What's the one process in your business you've never written down? Drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: What's the one process you've never written down?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"You don't have a business, you have a job" is a genuinely great hook — it will stop the scroll because it stings. The "sellable, scalable, survivable" trio is a clean and memorable reframe. Top-15 candidate. Pairs with Script #22 for a systems week.
