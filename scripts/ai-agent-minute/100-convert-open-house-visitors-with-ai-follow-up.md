# Convert Open House Visitors With AI Follow-Up

**Category:** Lead Generation | **Avatar:** All | **AI Tool:** Claude

## On-Screen Title
> Convert Open House Visitors With AI Follow-Up — Not Sign-In Sheets

## Shareable Moment
> "Open houses give you something most lead sources never will — a real human conversation. Most agents treat it like a transaction. The ones who don't convert at a completely different rate."

## Why This Rank
Lowest raw score in the entire series; the open house follow-up angle is tactical but the hook lacks the scroll-stopping urgency of every other script.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You're sitting open houses every weekend and converting almost none of them — and it has nothing to do with the house. [ON-SCREEN: "It has nothing to do with the house"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's actually happening. Most agents collect sign-in sheets, send a generic "thanks for stopping by" email the next morning, and consider it done. The lead goes cold because there was never a real continuation of the conversation — just a transaction.
And here's the part that stings — open houses give you something most lead sources never will. You had a real conversation with that person. Most agents waste it. [ON-SCREEN: "You had a real conversation. Most agents waste it."]
Here's the fix. After your open house, spend five minutes typing quick notes about each visitor into Claude — what they said, what caught their attention, how serious they seemed. Then type: "Write a personalized next-day follow-up for each visitor that references the specific conversation we had, and include a tailored listing recommendation based on what they told me they were looking for." [ON-SCREEN: "Write a follow-up that references the specific conversation"]
Not a template. A message that makes them think: this agent actually remembered me.
What's your current open house follow-up process? Tell me in the comments — I want to hear it. [ON-SCREEN: What's your open house follow-up process?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Weakest hook in the batch even after revision — "it has nothing to do with the house" is better than the original but still not scroll-stopping. Consider reshooting the hook as: "The average agent sits three open houses a month and converts zero of them into clients. Here's the two-minute fix." Schedule later in the series.
