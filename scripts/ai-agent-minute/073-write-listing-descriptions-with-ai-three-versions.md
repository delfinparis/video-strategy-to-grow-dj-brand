## On-Screen Title
> Write Listing Descriptions With AI — Three Versions — More Showings

## Shareable Moment
> "Buyers buy stories before they buy houses. AI helps you write a story worth reading — in five minutes instead of forty-five."

## Why This Rank
Listing descriptions are a daily task; three-version strategy (MLS, social, email) creates an efficiency multiplier.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your listing description is often the first thing a buyer reads after the photos — and most of them are genuinely terrible. Agents know it. They write them that way anyway. [ON-SCREEN: "Most listing descriptions are genuinely terrible"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the problem. Most agents either fill the description with clichés — "charming," "cozy," "move-in ready," "nestled" — or they spend forty-five minutes agonizing over a single paragraph. Neither approach wins you more showings. And the clichés actively signal that no one thought carefully about this particular home.
Most agents describe houses. Top agents write stories about them. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents describe houses. Top agents write stories."]
Here's the fix. Before writing any listing description, give Claude the property's key features, the neighborhood, the ideal buyer profile, and one emotional selling point — a view, a lifestyle, a story unique to this house. Then type: "Write three versions of this listing description: one aspirational, one feature-focused, one neighborhood-first. Each under two hundred words. Zero real estate clichés." [ON-SCREEN: "3 versions — aspirational, feature-focused, neighborhood-first. No clichés."]
Pick the best version, personalize it, and you're done in five minutes instead of forty-five.
Buyers buy stories before they buy houses. What's the worst listing description cliché you've ever seen? Drop it below — I know you have one. [ON-SCREEN: What's the worst listing description cliché you've seen?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The CTA about "worst cliché" will generate extremely high comment volume — it's fun, shareable, and low-stakes. Expect viral comment thread potential. "Nestled" will appear in 90% of responses. This is a strong engagement driver even if it's not the deepest script.
