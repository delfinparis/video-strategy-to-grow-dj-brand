## On-Screen Title
> Learn Gen Z Buyer Behavior With AI — Adapt Now — Capture The Coming Wave

## Shareable Moment
> "Gen Z is making fifty percent more income than Boomers were at their age. They can afford homes. The question is whether you can afford to ignore them."

## Why This Rank
Gen Z is entering peak home-buying age; agents who adapt their approach now build a decade-long client base.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Gen Z is entering the housing market right now — and most agents have absolutely no idea how to talk to them. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents have no idea how to talk to them"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the gap most agents are missing. Gen Z buyers have done twelve hours of research before they ever contact you. They communicate by text — not phone calls. They trust peer reviews more than professional claims. And they can detect inauthenticity in about four seconds. If you approach them the way you approach Boomer clients, you'll lose them before the first showing.
Most agents know one generation well. The top producers adapt their approach to whoever is in front of them. [ON-SCREEN: "Adapt your approach — or lose them before the first showing"]
Here's how to adapt. Use Perplexity to pull current research on Gen Z home-buying behavior — what they value, how they communicate, what their actual financial profile looks like. Then bring that into Claude and type: "Based on this research, help me rewrite my buyer consultation, my follow-up process, and my communication style specifically for a Gen Z first-time buyer." [ON-SCREEN: "Rewrite my process for Gen Z — consultation, follow-up, communication"]
Here's the number that should get your attention: Gen Z is making fifty percent more income than Boomers were at their age. They can afford homes. The question is whether you can afford to ignore them.
Have you worked with a Gen Z buyer? Tell me what surprised you most. [ON-SCREEN: Worked with a Gen Z buyer? What surprised you?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Verify the "50% more income than Boomers at their age" stat before filming — widely cited but source should be confirmed. The stat is the most shareable moment in the script and worth the verification effort. This is a forward-looking script with growing relevance over time.
