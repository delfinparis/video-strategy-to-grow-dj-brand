## Why This Rank
'Count conversations, not appointments' reframe is the most actionable mindset shift in the series with broad viral potential.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The agents who prospect every morning without dreading it didn't develop a love for rejection. They built a system that makes showing up easier than skipping. [ON-SCREEN: They don't love rejection. They have a system.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why most agents dread prospecting. They've defined success as booking an appointment — which means almost every session feels like a failure. The agents who do it consistently have made one mental shift: success is having three real conversations today. That's it. Not appointments. Conversations. That reframe changes your relationship with the phone entirely. You go from dreading rejection to counting connections. [ON-SCREEN: Define success as conversations — not appointments. Everything changes.]
And here's the part most agents never fix — without a ritual around it, prospecting is always a decision you have to make fresh every morning. And fresh decisions get vetoed.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you design a thirty-minute morning prospecting ritual — not a to-do list, a psychological framework. Include: a two-minute mindset warm-up, a daily target you can realistically hit, a script refresh for the first call so you don't start cold, a win-tracking system that counts conversations not just appointments, and a two-minute debrief at the end. Same process, same time, every morning. Consistency builds confidence faster than any motivation hack. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Design my 30-minute morning prospecting ritual with a mindset warm-up, realistic daily target, script refresh, win tracker, and debrief."]
Prospecting doesn't have to feel like a grind. It feels like a grind because you've never built a ritual around it. Open Claude today — this takes fifteen minutes to build.
What time of day do you do your best prospecting? Drop your peak time below — I'm curious what the pattern is. [ON-SCREEN: Your best prospecting time?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Top-10 candidate — the "count conversations not appointments" reframe is the most actionable mindset shift in the entire series. Strong virality and share potential. Film early.
