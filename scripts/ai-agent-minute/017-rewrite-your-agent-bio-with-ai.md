## On-Screen Title
> Rewrite Your Agent Bio With AI — Not A Generic Template — Make A Real First Impression

## Shareable Moment
> "Your bio isn't a resume. It's your first sales conversation. Most agents are sending prospects to sleep with it."

## Why This Rank
Every agent has a bad bio and knows it; this is an immediate-action script with a clear before/after transformation built in.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your agent bio is either making someone want to call you — or making them keep scrolling. Right now, most bios are doing the second one. [ON-SCREEN: "Most bios make them keep scrolling"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what the typical agent bio looks like. "John has been helping buyers and sellers in the greater metro area for fifteen years with a commitment to excellence and client satisfaction." Nobody reads past the first sentence. Not because they're busy — because there's nothing in that sentence worth reading. It says nothing about who John is, who he's best at helping, or why a specific kind of person would want to work with him over any other agent.
Most bios prove the agent exists. Top producer bios make you want to call before you've even finished reading. [ON-SCREEN: "Prove you exist vs. make them want to call"]
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you rewrite your bio using a story-first framework. Give it the honest answers to: Why did you get into real estate? What do you love about this work? Who do you serve best — and why are you better for them than anyone else? What's one thing you believe about real estate that most agents would disagree with? Type: "Turn these answers into a bio that reads like a real person wrote it — because one did. Make the first line stop a scroll." [ON-SCREEN: "Why you started + what you love + who you serve best + one contrarian belief"]
Your bio isn't a resume. It's your first sales conversation.
Read your current bio right now — does it actually sound like you? Yes or no. [ON-SCREEN: Does your bio actually sound like you?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim the "nobody reads past the first sentence" elaboration on delivery. The "John" example is smart — it's specific enough to be funny without calling anyone out. Top-15 candidate. High share potential.
