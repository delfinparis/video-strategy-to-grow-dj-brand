## On-Screen Title
> Handle Difficult Clients With AI — Respond Strategically — Protect The Deal

## Shareable Moment
> "Difficult clients don't need a reactive agent. They need a calm, strategic one. AI helps you become that — before you send a single word."

## Why This Rank
Every agent has a nightmare client story; the AI-as-emotional-buffer angle is fresh and validating.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your most difficult client isn't testing your patience. They're testing your systems — and most agents don't have one. [ON-SCREEN: "They're testing your systems — and most agents don't have one"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's really happening when a client becomes difficult. They're almost always anxious, uninformed, or feel out of control. And most agents respond by getting defensive, avoiding the conversation, or matching the client's energy. None of those work. All of them put the deal at risk — and often the relationship along with it.
The worst thing you can do with a difficult client is respond in real time, from emotion, with no strategy. [ON-SCREEN: "Never respond in real time from emotion — with no strategy"]
Here's the fix. When a difficult client situation comes up — before you respond — bring it to Claude. Describe exactly what happened and type: "How should I respond to this situation to de-escalate, preserve the relationship, and keep the deal on track? Give me three communication approaches based on what the client's emotional state is likely to be." [ON-SCREEN: "3 approaches based on their likely emotional state"]
Pick the one that fits. Execute it calmly. Never send an emotional response in real time.
Difficult clients don't need a reactive agent. They need a calm, strategic one. AI helps you be that — every single time.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
"No names needed" in the CTA is an important trust signal that will unlock more honest, detailed responses. The "never respond in real time from emotion" line is immediately actionable and quotable. Strong client management anchor script.
