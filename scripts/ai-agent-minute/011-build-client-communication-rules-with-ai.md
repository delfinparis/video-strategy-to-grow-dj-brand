# Build Client Communication Rules With AI

## On-Screen Title
> Build Client Communication Rules With AI — Protect Your Time — Serve Better

## Shareable Moment
> "It's not a boundary. It's a system. And the agents who have it serve their best clients at a dramatically higher level than the ones who don't."

## Why This Rank
The 'client boundary' topic will generate strong comment engagement from agents who've been burned by 24/7 availability culture.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Every "yes" you say to the wrong thing is a "no" to something that actually matters — and most agents have no idea how many wrong yeses they're saying every single day. [ON-SCREEN: "Every wrong yes is a no to something that matters"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happened to most veteran agents. They built a reputation on being available and responsive. And now clients expect them available for everything — on-demand showings, 9 PM texts, weekend calls for things that could wait a week. You accidentally trained people to treat your time as free.
And the cruelest part? The more available you are for everyone, the less present you can be for the clients who actually deserve your best. [ON-SCREEN: "The more available you are for everyone — the worse you serve your best clients"]
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to write a "communication expectations" document you send every new client at the start of the relationship. Type: "Write a warm, professional one-page document that sets clear response time standards, defines what constitutes a real emergency versus what can wait, and explains how I work best. It should feel like a system — not a boundary." [ON-SCREEN: "Write a document that sets my communication standards — warmly"]
It's not a boundary. It's a system. And systems are how great agents protect the time that makes them great.
Have you ever lost a deal because you were too busy managing everyone's small requests? Tell me below. [ON-SCREEN: Have you ever lost a deal from being too spread thin?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim the "cruelest part" sentence if needed. The "not a boundary, it's a system" reframe is the most quotable line in this script and in the top five of the entire batch. Top-15 candidate. High resonance with burned-out veteran segment.
