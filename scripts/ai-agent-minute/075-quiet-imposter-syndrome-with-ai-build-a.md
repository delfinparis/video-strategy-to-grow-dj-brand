## Why This Rank
Imposter syndrome is the dominant fear for new agents; the 'competency file' is a concrete, Claude-buildable confidence tool.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You feel like a fraud. I have news for you — so did every top producer I've ever interviewed when they were starting out. [ON-SCREEN: "So did every top producer when they started"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what imposter syndrome actually is. It's not a personality flaw. It's a mismatch between the standards you hold yourself to and the evidence you currently have that you meet them. You spent months studying for a license. Now you're supposed to advise people on the biggest financial decision of their lives. That gap feels enormous. And it shows up every time a client asks a question that makes you pause.
But here's what the agents who pushed through figured out — you can actually close that gap. On purpose. With evidence. [ON-SCREEN: "You can close that gap on purpose — with evidence"]
Here's how. Ask Claude to help you build a "competence inventory" — a running document of everything you actually know: every transaction you've supported, every training you've completed, every question you've answered correctly. Type: "Help me create a document that tracks my growing real estate expertise so I can reference it when I doubt myself." Update it weekly. [ON-SCREEN: "Track your growing expertise — update it weekly"]
Imposter syndrome thrives in the dark. When you can see in writing what you actually bring to the table — the voice gets quieter.
You don't need to know everything. You need to know more than your client. And you already do.
When did you last feel like a fraud in this business? Tell me below — it's more common than you think. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last feel like a fraud?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs long — trim the "every question you've answered correctly" section or tighten the problem. The credibility signal ("every top producer I've ever interviewed") is perfectly natural here. This script has unusually high emotional resonance for new agents — consider running it during a week where new agent content is prioritized.
