## Shareable Moment

## Why This Rank
High-stakes, immediate-stakes content that any agent with a listing appointment this week will save.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The listing appointment is won before you ever walk in the door — and the agent who knows that almost always gets the listing. [ON-SCREEN: "Won before you walk in the door"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the reality most agents don't think about. That seller has already Googled you, looked at your recent sales, and formed an opinion before you ring the doorbell. You're walking in already behind — showing up with a generic CMA and the same presentation you use for every house.
Meanwhile the top listing agents in every market I've talked to in twelve years all have the same habit: they do homework the night before that most agents never do. [ON-SCREEN: "They do homework most agents never do"]
Here's what that looks like. The night before any listing appointment, give Claude the property address, recent neighborhood comps, and the seller's name. Then type: "Generate the five most likely objections I'll face at this specific listing appointment, a response to each one, and three value-differentiators specific to this property and neighborhood." [ON-SCREEN: "Generate the 5 objections I'll face — and a response to each"]
Walk in knowing what they'll push back on. With your answer already ready.
This prep takes fifteen minutes. It is the highest-ROI fifteen minutes in listing sales.
What's the most common objection you face at listing appointments? Tell me in the comments. [ON-SCREEN: What's your most common listing objection?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Top-10 candidate — film in week one. The "homework the night before" framing is the kind of simple habit story that agents will share with colleagues. Credibility signal (twelve years of interviews) lands naturally here.
