## Shareable Moment
> "After ten years, most veteran agents aren't underperforming — they're overdoing things that stopped working years ago."

## Why This Rank
Directly addresses the Burned-Out Veteran avatar's core tension; the specificity of 'Zillow campaign from 2019' is the mirror moment.

## Full Script (Spoken)

After a decade in real estate, most veteran agents aren't doing too little. They're exhausted by doing too much of the wrong things. [ON-SCREEN: Ten years in and burning out? The problem isn't effort.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what accumulates over ten years without anyone noticing: a Zillow campaign from 2019 that stopped producing. Three networking events you attend out of guilt. A monthly newsletter that takes four hours and generates zero calls. Tools you're paying for and barely opening. None of it gets audited — it just keeps running on autopilot while you get more tired. The complexity you've built over a decade is exhausting you without proportional return. [ON-SCREEN: How many things in your business are still running from 5 years ago?]
And the reason nothing gets cut is that it feels risky to stop anything — even the things that haven't worked in years.
Here's the fix. Sit down with Claude and do a full business simplification audit. List every lead source, marketing activity, tool, event, and professional commitment currently in your business. Then ask: "Which of these are most likely driving eighty percent of my production? Which can I eliminate without materially affecting my results? What does my simplified, high-leverage business look like if I cut everything else?" Then do the hard thing — actually cut what it tells you to cut. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Here's everything in my business. Which 20% drives 80% of results? What should I eliminate?"]
Simplicity isn't giving up. It's identifying your highest leverage and going all in on it. The agents who do this audit report getting more done in thirty hours than they used to in fifty.
What's one thing in your business you're still doing out of habit rather than conviction? Drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: Still doing it out of habit?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
High-virality candidate in the veteran/burned-out segment — the specificity of "Zillow campaign from 2019" and "three networking events out of guilt" will generate strong mirror moment recognition. Film early in the series. The "30 hours vs. 50 hours" claim should be presented as anecdotal unless verifiable.
