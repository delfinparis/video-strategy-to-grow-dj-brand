## On-Screen Title
> Competing on Split Is a Race You'll Lose

## Shareable Moment
> "If your only differentiator is the split, you've already lost — because someone will always go lower."

## Why This Rank
Strong hook, practical differentiation framework; high relevance for team leaders losing talent to split wars.

## Full Script (Spoken)

If the only thing separating your recruiting pitch from every other team leader's is your commission split — you're in a price war you cannot win. [ON-SCREEN: Competing on split = race to the bottom]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Most team leaders give the same recruiting pitch: great leads, solid split, strong support. The problem is every team leader in your market says the exact same thing. The agents worth recruiting — the ones who actually produce — they're not choosing based on your split. They're choosing based on whether they believe your team will actually make them better. [ON-SCREEN: "Great leads, solid split, good support" = every team leader ever]
And here's where it gets harder — if you can't clearly articulate what makes your team different, neither can your agents when they refer someone to you.
Here's the fix. Before you write a single recruiting email, answer these questions: What specific type of agent is your team designed to help? What does an agent gain from you that they genuinely can't get elsewhere? What's the career trajectory for someone who joins and excels? What does your culture actually feel like on an average Tuesday afternoon — not your best day, your average one? Ask Claude to take your honest answers and turn them into a differentiated recruiting pitch that attracts the right agents and naturally filters out the wrong ones. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Here are my answers to four questions about my team. Turn them into a differentiated recruiting pitch."]
The best recruiting pitch doesn't appeal to every agent — it speaks so directly to one specific type of agent that they feel like you wrote it for them.
What's your current one-line answer to "why should I join your team over any other option?" Drop it in the comments. Let's workshop it. [ON-SCREEN: Your one-liner: why join your team?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Strong differentiation from Script #81 — that's onboarding, this is recruiting pitch; no overlap. The CTA "let's workshop it" will generate high comment volume — smart engagement hook. No accuracy concerns.
