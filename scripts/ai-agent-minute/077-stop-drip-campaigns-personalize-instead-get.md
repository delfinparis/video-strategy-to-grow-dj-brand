# Stop Drip Campaigns — Personalize Instead — Get Responses

**Category:** Lead Generation | **Avatar:** Forgotten Middle | **AI Tool:** Claude
**Score:** 6.7 | **Rank:** 77 of 100 | **Tier:** 4 (Deep Catalog)
**Post Date:** Wednesday, August 19, 2026

## On-Screen Title
> Stop Drip Campaigns — Personalize Instead — Get Responses

## Shareable Moment
> "The agents winning right now aren't sending more messages — they're sending more human ones. Claude makes that possible in under two minutes per lead."

## Why This Rank
Strong premise but the comment-to-DM CTA mechanism requires setup before filming; bump up once that's resolved.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your CRM drip campaign is quietly killing your business — and I'm going to show you the two-minute Claude prompt that fixes it. [ON-SCREEN: "Your drip campaign is killing your business"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Generic 'just checking in' messages tell every buyer the same thing: you don't remember who they are. Today's clients can smell mass automation instantly. It goes straight to delete.
And here's the part most agents miss — it's not a follow-up problem. It's a listening problem. [ON-SCREEN: "It's not a follow-up problem. It's a listening problem."]
Here's the fix. After every lead call, spend sixty seconds dictating notes into your phone — what they're looking for, their timeline, their biggest fear. Then paste those notes into Claude and type: "Write a personalized follow-up message that references exactly what this person told me. Sound like I was paying close attention to every word." [ON-SCREEN: "Write a personalized follow-up that references exactly what this person told me"]
Not a template. A message that proves you listened.
Most agents send more messages. Top producers send more human ones — at scale. Open Claude after your next call. This takes ninety seconds.
Comment "FOLLOW-UP" below and I'll send you the exact prompt I use for this. [ON-SCREEN: Comment "FOLLOW-UP" for the prompt]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Confirm the comment-to-DM delivery mechanism before filming — do you have a tool set up (ManyChat, etc.) or are you manually replying? Don't film until that's nailed down.
