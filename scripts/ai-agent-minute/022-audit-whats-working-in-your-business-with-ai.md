## On-Screen Title
> Audit What's Working In Your Business With AI — Not Just Fix What's Broken — Reignite Your Momentum

## Shareable Moment
> "Growth doesn't always come from doing something new. Sometimes it comes from finally seeing clearly what you're already doing right — and doing more of it."

## Why This Rank
The retrospective audit angle is underused in real estate content; appeals strongly to veterans who feel busy but not productive.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Most agents spend all their energy fixing what's wrong with their business. Almost none of them spend time doubling down on what's right. [ON-SCREEN: "Almost none double down on what's right"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happens when you only focus on what's broken. You develop tunnel vision. Every week is about solving the problem in front of you — the slow lead source, the skill gap, the thing you're doing wrong. Meanwhile, the two or three things that are quietly working — the lead source that converts best, the client type you serve effortlessly, the marketing that actually gets results — never get more of your time and attention. They just keep doing their quiet, efficient work while you pour energy into trying to fix everything else.
Most agents grow by adding new things. Top producers often grow by doing more of what already works. [ON-SCREEN: "More of what already works"]
Here's the audit. List your last twenty closed deals and where each came from. List the client types who were easiest and most enjoyable to serve. List the marketing you've done that actually produced measurable results. Give that to Claude and type: "Identify the patterns: which lead sources are already working best for me, which client types are my strongest fit, and which of my activities has the highest return for the effort I put in. Then tell me: what would happen if I committed to doubling down on just the top three for ninety days?" [ON-SCREEN: "Last 20 deals → sources → client types → best marketing → double down on top 3"]
Growth doesn't always come from doing something new. Sometimes it comes from finally seeing clearly what you're already doing right.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs long — needs to be trimmed to approximately 115 seconds on delivery. Cut "They just keep doing their quiet, efficient work while you pour energy into trying to fix everything else" — it's good but not essential. The CTA asking "what's working better than everything else" will generate positive, shareable comments — unusually strong engagement potential because it invites success stories rather than problems.
