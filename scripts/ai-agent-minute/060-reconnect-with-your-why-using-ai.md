## On-Screen Title
> Reconnect With Your Why Using AI — Find The Fuel That Outlasts Motivation

## Shareable Moment
> "Motivation runs out. Every single time. The agents who last aren't more motivated — they're more connected to their reason."

## Why This Rank
Permission-slip content for agents who've lost their motivation; the 'your why is still there' reframe is validating.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Motivation runs out. Every single time. The agents who last aren't more motivated than you — they're more connected to their reason. [ON-SCREEN: "They're not more motivated. They're more connected to their reason."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happens in year three, or year five, or year ten. The excitement that carried you in the beginning fades — and you're left with just the work. Without a deeply personal reason for continuing, the hard days feel impossible. And real estate has a lot of hard days.
Most agents push through on willpower. The ones who stay in the game for decades found something deeper to run on. [ON-SCREEN: "Found something deeper to run on"]
Here's how to find it. Set aside thirty minutes with Claude for what I call a "why excavation." Type: "Ask me these four questions and then help me turn my answers into a personal mission statement for my business: Why did I get into real estate? What does success in this business actually give me — specifically? What would I regret most if I quit? Who am I doing this for?" [ON-SCREEN: "4 questions → your personal mission statement"]
Ask Claude to turn your answers into one paragraph. Print it. Put it somewhere you'll see it on the hard days.
Clarity about your why doesn't make hard days easy. It makes them worthwhile.
When's the last time you actually thought about why you're doing this? Tell me below. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last think about why you're doing this?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim "year three, or year five, or year ten" to "year three or year ten" on delivery. This is one of the most emotionally resonant scripts in the entire series — save it for a moment when the audience is established and trusts D.J. Don't open with this one. The "why excavation" framing is distinctive and ownable.
