# Divorce Is the Most Consistent Lead Source Nobody Pursues

**Category:** Lead Gen / Conversion | **Avatar:** Forgotten Middle / Aspiring Top Producer | **AI Tool:** Claude
**Score:** 7.0 | **Rank:** 59 of 100 | **Tier:** 3 (Strong Catalog)
**Post Date:** Wednesday, July 08, 2026

## On-Screen Title
> Divorce Is the Most Consistent Lead Source Nobody Pursues

## Shareable Moment
> "One strong relationship with the right divorce attorney can generate five to ten deals a year — consistently, regardless of the market."

## Why This Rank
Genuinely distinctive niche that most agents have never considered; the 5-10 deals/year from one attorney relationship is the shareable hook.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Divorce is the second most common reason couples sell their home — and most agents have never contacted a single divorce attorney to introduce themselves. [ON-SCREEN: Second most common reason people sell: divorce. How many attorneys do you know?]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Family law attorneys need real estate agents on call — agents who can handle emotionally charged transactions with competing clients, provide accurate asset valuations under pressure, and close deals when neither seller particularly wants to cooperate. These transactions are complex. They require patience, emotional intelligence, and technical competence. Most agents don't specialize in this, don't understand what divorce attorneys need, and have no positioning in this niche whatsoever. So the attorneys who need help either use whoever they happen to know — or the same agent they've used for twenty years. [ON-SCREEN: Attorneys need an agent who can handle this. Are you that agent?]
And here's the opportunity — that relationship is usually available because most agents never try to build it.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you build a divorce attorney outreach package. It includes: a professional introduction letter that explains your experience with high-stakes, emotionally complex transactions; a one-page overview of how you specifically handle the challenges of a divorce sale — dual representation dynamics, court-ordered timelines, asset valuation; and three anonymized case examples that demonstrate your competence. Identify five family law attorneys in your market. Send the package this week. One strong relationship with the right attorney generates five to ten deals a year — in any market. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Draft a divorce attorney outreach package: intro letter, one-page service overview, and three anonymized case study summaries."]
Divorce clients need the most competent, patient agent in the room. AI helps you position yourself as exactly that — before you ever meet one.

## Producer Note
Distinctive niche — no other script in the batch covers referral relationships with non-real-estate professionals. Strong specificity. No accuracy concerns; divorce as second most common reason to sell is well-documented. Film this — it will generate strong comment engagement.
