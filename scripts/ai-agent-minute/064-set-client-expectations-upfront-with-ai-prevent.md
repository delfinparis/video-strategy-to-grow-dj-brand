## On-Screen Title
> Set Client Expectations Upfront With AI — Prevent Problems Before They Start

## Shareable Moment
> "Ninety percent of client problems in real estate come from expectations that were never set. That's not a client problem. That's a systems problem."

## Why This Rank
Client expectation failures are universal; proactive documentation via AI prevents the reactivity trap.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Ninety percent of client problems in real estate come from expectations that were never set. And most agents have been paying for that mistake for years. [ON-SCREEN: "From expectations that were never set"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what that actually looks like. The 9 PM texts. The "why didn't you tell me about this?" conversation. The client who expects a response within the hour on a Sunday. Every one of those moments was preventable — if someone had explained clearly at the start of the relationship what the process looks like, what the client is responsible for, and what to realistically expect from their agent.
Most agents hope clients figure it out. Top producers explain it upfront — before the first problem. [ON-SCREEN: "Explain it upfront — before the first problem"]
Here's the fix. Use Claude to build a "client expectations document" — two pages you send to every new buyer or seller at the very start of the relationship. Type: "Write a warm, professional document that covers how I communicate and my typical response times, the transaction timeline and what happens at each stage, the client's responsibilities, and the three most common surprises in real estate and how I handle them." [ON-SCREEN: "Communication + timeline + client responsibilities + common surprises"]
Send this before the first showing. Setting expectations isn't defensive. It's the first act of excellent client service.
What's the most common "why didn't you tell me?" conversation you have with clients? Drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: What's your most common "why didn't you tell me?" moment?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim "for years" from the hook or the "three most common surprises" from the prompt. The "9 PM texts" mirror moment is instantly recognizable to every agent. The CTA will generate specific, useful answers that could feed future content.
