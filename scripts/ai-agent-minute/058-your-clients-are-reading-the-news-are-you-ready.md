# Your Clients Are Reading the News. Are You Ready to Discuss It?

**Category:** Personal Brand / Market | **Avatar:** All | **AI Tool:** Perplexity + Claude
**Score:** 7.0 | **Rank:** 58 of 100 | **Tier:** 3 (Strong Catalog)

## On-Screen Title
> Your Clients Are Reading the News. Are You Ready to Discuss It?

## Shareable Moment
> "The agent who always has a smart take on the latest market news becomes the agent clients call first — not just when they're ready to transact."

## Why This Rank
Market intelligence as a competitive edge is underused; the 'your client knows more than you' mirror moment is uncomfortable and sticky.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Nothing damages your credibility with a client faster than being the last person in the room to know about something happening in your own industry. [ON-SCREEN: Your client read about it this morning. Do you know what they're going to ask?]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Real estate moves fast. Rate decisions. NAR policy changes. New legislation. Local inventory shifts. There's always something that a client might bring up — and when they bring it up before you do, you've already communicated something about your level of engagement. Most agents stay informed by accident. They catch a headline on their phone. They hear something from another agent at an open house. That's not a system. And it shows the moment a client asks a question you haven't thought about. [ON-SCREEN: Staying informed "by accident" isn't a strategy.]
And here's the flip side — the agent who always has a smart take on the latest market news becomes the agent clients call first. Not just when they're ready to transact. Whenever they have a question.
Here's the fix. Build a twenty-minute Monday morning market intelligence routine. Ask Perplexity for the top five real estate news stories from the past week — national and local. Then ask Claude to summarize each in two sentences and suggest how you'd explain each one to a client in plain language. You start every week fully briefed. You become the agent who always seems to know what's happening — because you built a system to make sure you do. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Summarize these 5 real estate news stories in 2 sentences each, and suggest how I'd explain each to a non-expert client."]
Twenty minutes every Monday. That's the whole investment. Open Claude and Perplexity this Monday morning — you'll be glad you did by your first client call.
What's the most recent real estate news story a client asked you about? Tell me the topic below. [ON-SCREEN: What did your client ask you about recently?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
The "last person to know in your own industry" hook is strong — D.J. should deliver it with a slight wince for maximum mirror moment effect. No accuracy concerns. Good broad appeal across all avatars.
