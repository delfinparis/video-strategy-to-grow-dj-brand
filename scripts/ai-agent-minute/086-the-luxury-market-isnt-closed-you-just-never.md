## Shareable Moment
> "Luxury clients don't stumble into their agent — they choose someone who already appears to belong in their world."

## Why This Rank
Luxury entry plan is ambitious and aspirational; the 'referrals don't convert when you're not ready' line is the best addition.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The luxury market isn't closed to you. Most agents just never built a serious plan for entering it — and hope is not a strategy. [ON-SCREEN: The luxury market isn't closed. You just never had a plan.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the trap most agents fall into: they assume you need luxury connections first, or a lucky referral that just falls in your lap. So they wait. Meanwhile, luxury clients — like all clients — are choosing agents based on expertise, credibility, and who appears to belong in their world. If you haven't built any of those signals, no connection will save you. Referrals don't convert when the agent isn't ready for the conversation. [ON-SCREEN: Waiting for a lucky referral isn't a luxury strategy.]
And here's what it costs you — every year you wait is another year of sub-million-dollar transactions compounding in the wrong direction.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to build you a ninety-day luxury market entry strategy. It should define: the specific neighborhoods or price ranges to focus on first, how to build market expertise before you have listings there, the five luxury-specific marketing elements to develop — photography standard, listing presentation quality, video, print collateral, and digital presence — and a target list of luxury-adjacent clients already in your existing network who may be underserved by their current agent. You start with people who already trust you. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Build me a 90-day luxury market entry strategy including expertise-building, marketing development, and a target client list."]
Luxury clients don't find agents randomly. They choose agents who already appear to belong in their world. AI helps you build that appearance — and then the substance to back it up.
What's genuinely holding you back from pursuing a higher price point right now? Tell me honestly — I read every comment. [ON-SCREEN: What's holding you back from going upmarket?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Good mid-tier performer. The "referrals don't convert when the agent isn't ready" line is the strongest addition. No overlap concerns. No accuracy issues.
