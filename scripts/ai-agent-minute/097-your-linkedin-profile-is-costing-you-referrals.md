## Shareable Moment
> "On LinkedIn, one good professional connection can be worth a hundred Instagram followers — because professionals refer professionals."

## Why This Rank
LinkedIn optimization is genuinely valuable but the platform has lower relevance for most field agents; strong for the corporate niche.

## Full Script (Spoken)

While every agent fights for attention on Instagram, the platform most likely to send you corporate relocation clients, investor referrals, and high-income buyers is sitting completely ignored. [ON-SCREEN: The platform agents ignore most = the one that pays best]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
LinkedIn is the most underutilized platform in real estate — and the gap between what most agents have there and what top producers have is enormous. Most agent profiles read like a bad resume: job title, brokerage name, years licensed. No story. No specific audience. No reason for a corporate professional, a relocation HR manager, or a high-net-worth buyer to reach out. If your LinkedIn profile were your only first impression, would it get a call? [ON-SCREEN: Does your LinkedIn profile make someone want to call you?]
Here's what that costs you — the professionals in your area who get transferred, who inherit money, who get promoted and buy up — they research agents on LinkedIn before they ever search Google.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to rewrite your LinkedIn profile as a thought-leadership hub, not a resume. Your headline should describe what you help people do — not just your title. Your about section should open with a story, not credentials. Your featured section should include your best market content, client testimonials, or media appearances. Give Claude the raw material — your career story, your specialty, your best results — and it writes every section. Then commit to one piece of content per week: a market insight, a professional tip, a client win. LinkedIn compounds slowly. But it compounds. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Rewrite my LinkedIn profile as a thought-leadership hub. Here's my background and specialty: [details]."]
On LinkedIn, you're not competing with every agent in your market — you're talking to professionals who refer other professionals. One good connection there is worth a hundred Instagram followers.
When's the last time you updated your LinkedIn profile? Drop the year — I won't judge. [ON-SCREEN: Last LinkedIn update: what year?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Slightly over 90 seconds — trim the featured section line if needed in post. Unique angle from other brand scripts. No accuracy concerns. Moderate virality potential — more niche appeal (LinkedIn-savvy agents) than broad audience.
