## On-Screen Title
> Run Team Meetings With AI — Not Wing The Agenda — Actually Move Your Team Forward

## Shareable Moment
> "A well-run team meeting multiplies your team's productivity. A poorly-run one drains it. The difference is always the agenda — and whether anyone built it on purpose."

## Why This Rank
Covers the Team Leader avatar, the most underrepresented in the series; practical and immediately deployable.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Most team meetings in real estate accomplish one thing: wasting everyone's time together instead of separately. [ON-SCREEN: "Wasting everyone's time together instead of separately"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what a bad team meeting looks like. Status updates that could have been an email. Venting sessions disguised as strategy. Motivational speeches that fade by Tuesday morning. And thirty minutes of "does anyone have anything else?" Everyone leaves slightly more behind than when they walked in.
Most team leaders run meetings by feel. The ones with real team traction run them on a structure. [ON-SCREEN: "Meetings by feel vs. meetings on structure"]
Here's the fix. Before every team meeting, give Claude your team's weekly numbers, your top three priorities, and any open issues from last week. Type: "Generate a forty-five minute meeting agenda with: a wins celebration segment, a metrics review, one focused training topic, the decision items that actually need the whole team, and specific next actions for each person. Make it tight — no filler." Send it the day before so everyone comes prepared. Run to the agenda. End on time. [ON-SCREEN: "Wins + metrics + training + decisions + next actions — 45 min, no filler"]
A well-run team meeting multiplies your team's productivity. A poorly-run one drains it. The difference is always the agenda.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "does anyone have anything else?" detail is the mirror moment — every team leader will recognize it painfully. Narrower audience (team leaders) but high resonance within that segment. CTA will generate candid, specific answers.
