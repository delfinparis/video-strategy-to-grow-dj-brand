## On-Screen Title
> Get On Camera With AI Prep — Kill The Blank Stare — Build Your Audience

## Shareable Moment
> "You don't need to be a great presenter. You need to be a real person talking about something you actually know. AI handles the outline. You handle being you."

## Why This Rank
Camera fear is universal; AI-scripted preparation reduces the activation energy barrier that keeps agents off video.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Every week you avoid posting video, someone else is showing up in the feed of people who should be your clients. [ON-SCREEN: "Someone else is showing up for your clients"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what camera anxiety actually looks like. Most agents know the data on video — they know it outperforms every other content format. But the fear of saying something wrong, looking awkward, or being judged keeps them off camera entirely. So they post graphics and carousels while their competitors build real audiences. And the gap compounds every single week.
The agents who are great on camera didn't start great. They started — and got better by doing it. [ON-SCREEN: "They didn't start great. They just started."]
Here's how to eliminate the blank stare. Before filming anything, give Claude your topic and type: "Give me five possible opening lines for a sixty-second video, three key points to cover, and a closing question for the viewer." Then say it out loud three times. Not to film it perfectly. Just to hear yourself say the words.
The first thirty seconds is what most people dread. Claude gets you past the blank page so you can get past the blank stare. [ON-SCREEN: "5 openers → 3 key points → say it out loud 3 times"]
You don't need to be a great presenter. You need to be a real person talking about something you know. AI handles the outline. You handle being you.
When's the last time you posted a talking-head video? Drop the date — even if it's been a while. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last post a talking-head video?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs long — cut "And the gap compounds every single week" and tighten the problem section. The "they didn't start great, they just started" contrast is the best line. The CTA asking for a date is specific enough to be fun rather than shaming.
