# Explain Your Value Post-NAR Settlement With AI

## On-Screen Title
> Explain Your Value Post-NAR Settlement With AI — Stop Losing On Fees

## Shareable Moment
> "The agents who can explain their value confidently post-settlement will win more clients. The ones who stumble will lose them — before the first showing."

## Why This Rank
The most time-sensitive script in the series; NAR settlement has left agents without language for their value proposition — this is that language.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The NAR settlement changed what buyers ask you — and most agents still don't have a clean answer. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents still don't have a clean answer"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening at first meetings right now. Buyers are being asked to sign representation agreements before you show them a single house. Many of them don't understand why, what they're agreeing to, or what you do to earn your fee. If you can't explain your value clearly in the first two minutes of that conversation — you're starting the relationship in a hole.
And some agents are losing clients before the first showing. Because they stumble through it. [ON-SCREEN: "Losing clients before the first showing"]
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you build a two-minute value conversation for new buyers. Type: "Write a clear, confident explanation of what I do as a buyer's agent, why a representation agreement actually protects the buyer — not just me — and what the compensation conversation looks like in plain English. Make it sound like a real person talking, not a legal disclosure." Then have Claude play a skeptical buyer who just read about the settlement online and push back on you. [ON-SCREEN: "Clear. Confident. Plain English. Sounds like a person."]
Practice until it stops feeling like a pitch and starts feeling like a conversation.
How are you currently handling the buyer rep agreement conversation? Tell me your approach below. [ON-SCREEN: How do you handle the buyer rep conversation?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Highly time-sensitive — film immediately. Post-NAR settlement content has significant search and share potential right now. Pairs with Script #11 (commission defense) for a NAR settlement mini-series. This one focuses on buyer rep; Script #11 on seller-side commission conversations.
