## On-Screen Title
> Repurpose One Piece Of Content Into A Week Of Posts — With AI

## Shareable Moment
> "Create once. Distribute everywhere. AI makes the multiplication instant — and most agents have no idea this is even possible."

## Why This Rank
Content efficiency is a top pain point for agents managing their own marketing; one-to-many leverage is immediately valuable.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You're leaving ninety percent of your content's value on the table every time you post something once and move on. [ON-SCREEN: "Leaving 90% of your content's value on the table"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the math most agents miss. A single podcast episode, video, or newsletter contains enough material for a full week of social media content across every platform. The agents who show up most consistently online aren't creating more — they're repurposing smarter. One piece of content, distributed everywhere, in the right format for each platform.
Most agents create one post. Top producers create one asset — and turn it into ten. [ON-SCREEN: "One asset → ten pieces of content"]
Here's the workflow. Give Claude any long-form content you've created — a video transcript, a podcast clip, a newsletter. Then type: "Turn this into: one LinkedIn post, three Instagram captions, five short insights I could post as text, and one email subject line I could test. Preserve the core idea — adapt the tone and format for each platform." [ON-SCREEN: "1 LinkedIn + 3 Instagram + 5 text posts + 1 email subject line"]
In fifteen minutes, one piece of content becomes a full week across every channel.
Create once. Distribute everywhere. This is the workflow the most consistent creators use — and you can start it with your next piece of content.
What's the best piece of content you've ever created that most people never saw? Tell me about it below. [ON-SCREEN: What's your best content that nobody saw?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The specific output list ("1 LinkedIn + 3 Instagram + 5 text + 1 email subject") is the kind of tactical detail agents will screenshot. The CTA about "best content nobody saw" will surface genuinely interesting answers and potential follow-up content ideas.
