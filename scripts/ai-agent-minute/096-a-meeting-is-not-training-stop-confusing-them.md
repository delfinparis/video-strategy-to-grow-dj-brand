## On-Screen Title
> A Meeting Is Not Training. Stop Confusing Them.

## Shareable Moment
> "If you're coaching the same problem every month, you don't have a people problem — you have a training system problem."

## Why This Rank
Training system design is important but the lowest emotional hook of the team leader scripts; pair with #81 and #82.

## Full Script (Spoken)

If you're still coaching your agents on the same skill gaps you were coaching six months ago — the problem isn't your agents. The problem is you don't have actual training. [ON-SCREEN: Coaching the same problems? You don't have training. You have meetings.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Most team leaders run "training" as a weekly meeting where they talk and agents half-listen. That's not training — that's broadcasting. Real skill development requires structured practice, written frameworks agents can reference after the meeting ends, and clear benchmarks so agents actually know when they've improved. Without those things, you'll coach the same objection handling problem this month that you coached four months ago. [ON-SCREEN: Talking at agents ≠ training them]
And here's what it's costing you — every skill gap that doesn't close is a deal that doesn't close.
Here's the fix. Pick your three most-coached skill gaps — objection handling, listing presentations, buyer consultations. For each one, ask Claude to build a structured learning module that includes: a one-page written framework the agent keeps, five roleplay scenarios with varying difficulty, three self-assessment questions, and one practical assignment to complete before the next meeting. You build each module once. Your team uses it forever — and every new agent who joins gets it automatically. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Build a training module for [skill] with a framework, 5 roleplay scenarios, 3 self-assessment questions, and one practical assignment."]
Your agents rise to the level of the training you give them. AI helps you build training that's actually worth rising to — in one afternoon.
What skill gap are you coaching on your team over and over without it sticking? Tell me the topic — I want to hear what's most common. [ON-SCREEN: What skill gap keeps coming back?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Solid but the least viral of the team leader batch — consider pairing it in a themed "team leader week" rather than leading with it. No accuracy concerns.
