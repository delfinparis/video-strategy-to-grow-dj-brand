## On-Screen Title
> Send Monthly Market Updates With AI — Become The Source They Trust

## Shareable Moment
> "If your clients are getting their market information from the news instead of from you — you've already lost your position as their trusted advisor. And you won't know until it's too late."

## Why This Rank
Market updates are table stakes; the 'become the source' positioning makes it about authority-building, not just content.

## Full Script (Spoken)

If your clients are getting their market information from the news instead of from you — you've already lost your position as their trusted advisor. [ON-SCREEN: "You've already lost your position as their trusted advisor"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening to your database right now. Your past clients and sphere are reading Zillow headlines and watching cable news segments about the housing market — content that's often alarmist, out of context, and completely irrelevant to what's actually happening in your specific neighborhood. They're forming opinions about the market without you. And when they're ready to move, they might not think to call you first.
The agent who becomes the most trusted source of local market information gets the most calls when it's time to buy or sell. [ON-SCREEN: "Most trusted source = most calls when it's time to move"]
Here's how to become that agent in twenty minutes a month. Pull your local MLS data — average sale price, days on market, list-to-sale ratio, active inventory. Give it to Claude and type: "Write a two-paragraph market update for homeowners in [your market] that explains what these numbers mean for a seller and a buyer. Make it conversational, not statistical. End with one specific actionable insight." [ON-SCREEN: "Conversational. Not statistical. One actionable insight."]
Send it to your entire database. Every month. Without fail.
Are you sending regular market updates to your database right now? Yes or no — drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: Are you sending monthly market updates?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim "without fail" section or the cable news description if needed. The "most trusted source = most calls" equation is the sharpest line. Pairs with Script #72 (monthly newsletter) — space these at least three weeks apart; they serve the same purpose through different channels.
