## Why This Rank
New construction confusion is widespread and expensive; the buyer protection angle creates urgency for agents to bring this guide to clients.

## Full Script (Spoken)

New construction buyers think they don't need an agent. That's because most agents have never shown them what one actually does in that transaction — which is protect them from the person who's trying to sell them a house. [ON-SCREEN: The builder's agent works for the builder. Not your buyer.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what most buyers don't know until it's too late. The onsite sales agent at a new construction development is friendly, professional, and entirely paid by the person sitting on the other side of the table from your client. They are not neutral. They cannot negotiate against their employer. There are real opportunities in a new construction deal — upgrade credits, lot premiums, closing cost concessions, extended rate locks — that a buyer's agent can go after. Most buyers don't know these exist. And agents who don't specialize here don't know how to ask. [ON-SCREEN: Builder agent ≠ neutral. They can't fight for your buyer.]
And here's what happens without you — the buyer signs a builder contract they didn't fully understand and pays for it for the next thirty years.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to build you a New Construction Buyer's Guide covering: why the onsite agent isn't their advocate, what a buyer's agent negotiates in a new construction deal, what to inspect at each construction milestone, the questions to ask before signing any builder contract, and what warranty terms are standard versus negotiable. Give this guide to every buyer who mentions new construction. You become the agent who knows this world — instead of the one who wings it. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Build me a New Construction Buyer's Guide covering agent roles, negotiation opportunities, construction inspections, contract questions, and warranty terms."]
New construction buyers who work with a knowledgeable agent get better deals, fewer surprises, and more protection. AI helps you become that agent before your next new construction inquiry.

## Producer Note
Slightly over 90 seconds — cut the "thirty years" sentence if needed. The "friendly, professional, and entirely paid by the other side" line is the shareable hook. No accuracy concerns; this is well-established buyer representation territory.
