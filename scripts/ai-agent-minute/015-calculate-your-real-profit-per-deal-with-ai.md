## On-Screen Title
> Calculate Your Real Profit Per Deal With AI — GCI Is A Vanity Number

## Shareable Moment
> "Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity. Most agents celebrate the wrong number."

## Why This Rank
Most agents have never run this math; the revelation that their profitable deal isn't actually profitable is the shareable shock moment.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your GCI number is a lie you tell yourself. What actually matters is what you keep. [ON-SCREEN: "Your GCI is a lie you tell yourself"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the math most agents never do. Splits, taxes, marketing, software, mileage, staging costs, referral fees — by the time you add it all up, a two-hundred-thousand-dollar GCI year might net you sixty thousand dollars. Maybe less. If you don't know your real profit number, you can't make a single intelligent decision about where to invest or where to cut.
Most agents celebrate gross income. Top producers measure net profit — per deal. [ON-SCREEN: "Top producers measure net profit — per deal"]
Here's the fix. Gather your last twelve months of income and expenses, roughly by category. Give that to Claude and type: "Help me calculate my real net profit per deal and per year. What are my highest-cost line items? Where am I spending money that isn't generating a return?" [ON-SCREEN: "Net profit per deal — highest costs — what's not generating return?"]
Then make one decision based on what you find. Just one.
Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity. Most agents celebrate the wrong number. You can run this analysis tonight.
Do you actually know your net profit per deal right now? Yes or no — be honest below. [ON-SCREEN: Do you know your net profit per deal?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Your GCI is a lie you tell yourself" is the second-best hook in this batch — will stop the scroll hard because it's provocative but true. The $200K GCI / $60K net example should be framed as illustrative, not stated as a universal fact. Top-10 candidate. Film early.
