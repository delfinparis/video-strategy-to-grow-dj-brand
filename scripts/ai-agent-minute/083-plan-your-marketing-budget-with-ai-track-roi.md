> Plan Your Marketing Budget With AI — Track ROI — Stop Spending On Faith

## Shareable Moment
> "A dollar tracked is a dollar multiplied. Most agents are spending on faith — and faith doesn't scale."

## Why This Rank
Marketing ROI tracking is unsexy but important; the 'stop guessing' angle makes it more compelling.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Most agents spend money on marketing the same way people spend on gym memberships — optimistically, and without ever tracking whether it's working. [ON-SCREEN: "Optimistically — without tracking if it's working"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the real problem. Without a system for tracking marketing ROI, you have no idea what's working. You keep spending on things because you "feel like" they're working, or because a colleague swore by them — not because you have actual data. This leads to thousands of dollars wasted every year on lead sources, mailers, and ads that never pay back.
Most agents spend on instinct. Top producers spend on evidence. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents spend on instinct. Top producers spend on evidence."]
Here's how to build the system. At the start of every quarter, bring Claude your available marketing budget and your business goals. Type: "Allocate my budget across channels based on my current production stage, my target client type, and what I know about my conversion history." Then build a simple tracking sheet — lead source, cost, leads generated, closings attributed, ROI. Review it every ninety days. [ON-SCREEN: "Lead source → cost → closings → ROI. Review quarterly."]
Let the data decide where next quarter's budget goes.
A dollar tracked is a dollar multiplied. Most agents are spending on faith. Faith doesn't scale.
What percentage of your marketing spend do you actually track for ROI? Drop a number — no judgment. [ON-SCREEN: What % of your marketing spend do you actually track?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The gym membership analogy is one of the best in the entire series — immediately relatable and slightly embarrassing in the right way. "No judgment" on the CTA lowers the barrier to participation. No accuracy issues.
