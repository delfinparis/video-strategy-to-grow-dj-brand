## Why This Rank
Negotiation prep is important but less differentiated than objection handling and roleplay scripts above it.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Most agents negotiate on instinct. Top producers negotiate with a written plan — and they build it before they ever pick up the phone. [ON-SCREEN: "Top producers have a written plan before they pick up the phone"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happens in a live negotiation. You're juggling your client's priorities, the other side's motivations, and your leverage — all at once, in real time, under pressure. Most agents improvise. And improvisation under pressure leaves money on the table.
Your client hired you to think clearly when things get hard. Most agents wait until they're on the phone to start thinking. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents start thinking when they're already on the phone"]
Here's the fix. Before any negotiation call, spend ten minutes with Claude. Give it the full deal picture — offer price, inspection issues, competing offers, seller motivation, your buyer's must-haves versus nice-to-haves. Then type: "Draft three negotiation scenarios ranked by likelihood, with the strongest talking points for each one." [ON-SCREEN: "Draft 3 scenarios ranked by likelihood — with talking points for each"]
Walk into that call with a game plan. Not gut feel.
Your client is counting on you to think clearly under pressure. Claude lets you do the hard thinking before the pressure even arrives.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Save this" CTA is effective for actionable content. The re-hook ("most agents start thinking when they're already on the phone") is the sharpest new line here. Pairs well with Script #9 for a skills-based week.
