## Why This Rank
Solid foundational advice for newbies but the lowest raw score in the series and the narrowest avatar.

## Full Script (Spoken)

New agents are spending thousands on Zillow leads while sitting on five hundred untapped contacts in their phone. [ON-SCREEN: "You have 500 untapped contacts in your phone right now"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what actually happens. The panic sets in, you think you need to buy leads or run ads, and you completely overlook the people who already know you, like you, and would trust you with a real estate referral — if they remembered you were in real estate. Half of them don't.
And the agents who go broke in year one almost always made the same mistake — they bought strangers while their sphere went quiet. [ON-SCREEN: "They bought strangers while their sphere went quiet"]
Here's the fix. Open Claude and list your contact categories — neighbors, former coworkers, college connections, gym people. Then type: "Write a personal, non-salesy outreach message for each of these groups explaining why I got into real estate. Not a mass announcement — individual messages that feel like they came from a friend." Then ask it for ten conversation starters for reconnecting with someone you haven't spoken to in a year. Not pitches. Real conversations. [ON-SCREEN: "Write personal outreach messages — not mass announcements"]
Your sphere doesn't need to be sold to. It just needs to be reminded you exist.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim "gym people" or the second agitation line on delivery. Best for platforms with high new-agent traffic. The comment CTA ("drop the number") will get high engagement because it's easy and slightly game-like.
