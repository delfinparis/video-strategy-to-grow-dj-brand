## On-Screen Title
> Audit Your Lead Source ROI With AI — Stop Guessing — Spend Smarter

## Shareable Moment
> "Top producers don't necessarily spend more on leads. They spend smarter — because they actually track where their money goes."

## Why This Rank
Data-driven but requires agents to have enough history to audit; better as mid-series depth content.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Most agents have no idea which of their lead sources actually makes them money — they're genuinely guessing with their own business. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents are guessing with their own business"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the uncomfortable question. If someone asked you right now for your cost per closed deal by lead source — Zillow, Facebook, farming, referrals — could you answer? In twelve years of talking to agents on my podcast, the honest answer is almost always no. And without that number, every marketing decision is a coin flip.
That means you could be spending thousands on sources that never close — and not even know it. [ON-SCREEN: "You could be spending thousands on sources that never close"]
Here's the fix. Export your last twenty-four months of closed deals from your CRM — include the lead source field. Paste it into Claude and type: "Analyze these lead sources by volume, conversion rate, and average commission. Which source has the best ROI — and which should I cut immediately?" [ON-SCREEN: "Which source has the best ROI — and which should I cut?"]
Claude will find patterns you've been too busy to spot.
Top producers don't spend more on leads. They spend smarter — because they track everything. You can run this audit tonight in under thirty minutes.
When's the last time you audited your lead source ROI? Be honest in the comments. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last audit your lead ROI?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The podcast credibility signal ("twelve years talking to agents") is naturally deployed here — keep it. Requires agents to have CRM data with lead source fields — consider adding a one-liner caveat for agents whose CRM tracking is incomplete.
