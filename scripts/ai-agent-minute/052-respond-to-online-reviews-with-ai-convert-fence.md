## On-Screen Title
> Respond To Online Reviews With AI — Convert Fence-Sitters Into Clients

## Shareable Moment
> "How you respond to a review tells future clients more about you than the review itself. Most agents never figured that out."

## Why This Rank
Review responses are an ignored conversion opportunity; the 'fence-sitter' framing makes the stakes concrete.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your online reviews aren't just feedback — they're your sales team. And most agents are leaving them completely unsupervised. [ON-SCREEN: "Your reviews are your sales team — unsupervised"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what most agents miss. Potential clients who are on the fence about calling you don't just read your reviews — they read how you responded to them. A thoughtful, warm, specific response to a five-star review signals personality, professionalism, and how you treat people. A generic "thanks for your kind words!" signals that you copy-pasted something and moved on. And a negative review you never responded to? That signals something much worse.
Most agents treat reviews like a report card. Top producers treat them like a first conversation with their next client. [ON-SCREEN: "Reviews are a first conversation with your next client"]
Here's the fix. For every new review you receive, give it to Claude and type: "Write a response that references something specific from this review, reinforces one key value I provided, and feels genuinely human — not corporate or templated." For negative reviews, type: "Help me write a calm, accountable response that shows future clients how I handle difficult situations professionally." [ON-SCREEN: "Specific. Warm. Human. Not a template."]
How you respond tells future clients more about you than the review itself. Do you respond to every review you receive? Yes, no, or sometimes — drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: Do you respond to every review?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Your reviews are your sales team — unsupervised" is a genuinely strong hook. The negative review response prompt is a specific and valuable addition that most agents genuinely need. No accuracy issues.
