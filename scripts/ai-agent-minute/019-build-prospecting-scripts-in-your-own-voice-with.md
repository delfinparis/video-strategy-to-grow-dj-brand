## On-Screen Title
> Build Prospecting Scripts In Your Own Voice With AI — Not Copy Someone Else's — Prospect With Authenticity

## Shareable Moment
> "Authenticity is a competitive advantage in prospecting. A script in your own voice is ten times more effective than a borrowed one — and AI helps you find yours."

## Why This Rank
Distinct from #94 (system) and #2 (cold call practice) — this addresses the inauthenticity trap that kills new agent confidence.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The reason most prospecting scripts feel fake is because they are. They were written for someone else — and your clients can hear the gap. [ON-SCREEN: "They were written for someone else"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happens when you use someone else's script. The words might be technically correct. But the delivery is slightly stiff, the cadence is a little off, and there's a half-second delay before every line where your brain is checking its memory instead of connecting with the person. Buyers and sellers can feel the difference between someone who believes what they're saying and someone who's reciting it. And they make their decision about you in those first fifteen seconds.
Most agents sound like they're quoting a training manual. Top producers sound like themselves. [ON-SCREEN: "Quoting a training manual vs. sounding like yourself"]
Here's how to build your own. Tell Claude: "I'm a real estate agent with [X] years of experience. I tend to be [warm/direct/analytical/conversational]. I call [FSBOs/expireds/sphere contacts] and my goal is to start a real conversation — not close anything on the first call. Write me an opening sixty seconds that sounds like me talking naturally — not a script. Then give me three variations so I can find the one that fits." [ON-SCREEN: "Write my opening 60 seconds — sounds like me, not a script"]
Practice the one that fits until it's automatic.
Authenticity is a competitive advantage in prospecting. AI helps you find your authentic voice. What's your current go-to opening line? Drop it below — let's workshop it. [ON-SCREEN: What's your go-to opening line? Drop it — let's workshop it.]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Half-second delay where your brain is checking its memory" is the most specific mirror moment in this script — extremely accurate for anyone who's used a borrowed script under pressure. The CTA inviting people to share their opening line is unusually interactive — respond personally to the best ones for high engagement. Top-15 candidate.
