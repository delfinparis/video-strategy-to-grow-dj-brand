## Full Script (Spoken)

Expired listings are the highest-intent leads in real estate — these sellers already tried to sell. They just need to try with someone better. [ON-SCREEN: "They already tried. They just need someone better."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why most expired outreach fails. The agent calls, says "I can sell your home," and sends a postcard with their headshot on it. That is exactly what the last three agents who failed those sellers said. Expired sellers aren't just skeptical — they're done with generic. Your outreach needs to be specific enough that they feel like you actually looked at their situation.
Most agents contact expireds. Top producers study them first. [ON-SCREEN: "Most contact them. Top producers study them first."]
Here's the fix. Give Claude the listing history — days on market, original price, every price reduction, any signals about why it didn't sell. Then type: "Draft a personalized outreach letter that acknowledges their frustration, identifies three specific reasons similar homes in this neighborhood sat on the market, and proposes a genuinely different approach. Don't sound confident. Sound thoughtful." Then ask for a follow-up call script that opens with a question — not a pitch. [ON-SCREEN: "Thoughtful > Confident. Question first — not a pitch."]
Personalized expired outreach converts at dramatically higher rates than generic. The data on this is clear.
Expired sellers don't need another agent who's certain they can sell it. They need one who was curious enough to ask what went wrong. Do you work expired listings? Tell me your current approach. [ON-SCREEN: What's your current expired listing approach?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Thoughtful over confident" is the sharpest reframe in this script — consider making it the on-screen callout. The CTA will draw agents who work this lead source and will create useful comment threads about expired strategies.
