## On-Screen Title

## Shareable Moment
> "AI is a force multiplier for your voice — not a replacement for it. The goal is more of you at scale. Not less of you."

## Why This Rank
Unique meta-AI angle nobody else is teaching; immediately practical with a before/after demonstration built into the format.

## Full Script (Spoken)

People can tell when AI wrote your content. And they trust it less when they can. [ON-SCREEN: "They trust it less when they can tell"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the mistake most agents make with AI content. They ask it to "write a post about real estate" and wonder why the result sounds exactly like every other AI-generated post in the feed. The audience senses it isn't really you — and authenticity is the entire point of building a personal brand. Generic AI content doesn't just fail to help. It actively signals that nobody thought carefully enough to actually show up.
Most agents use AI to replace their voice. The top producers use it to amplify it. [ON-SCREEN: "Replace your voice vs. amplify it — completely different results"]
Here's the fix. Before asking Claude to write anything for you, spend five minutes training it on your voice. Paste three to five examples of content you've actually written — captions, emails, texts. Then type: "Analyze my writing style: my tone, vocabulary, sentence length, and personality. Now write a post about [topic] in that exact voice. Don't sound like AI. Sound like me." [ON-SCREEN: "Analyze my style — then write in that exact voice"]
Do this once and save it as a Claude Project. Every piece of content you create after that will actually sound like you.
AI is a force multiplier for your voice — not a replacement for it. Does your AI content actually sound like you right now? Be honest below. [ON-SCREEN: Does your AI content actually sound like you?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs slightly long — trim "Generic AI content doesn't just fail to help" sentence if needed. This is a top-15 candidate — the "Claude Project voice training" tip is genuinely novel and immediately actionable. The "does your content actually sound like you" CTA will drive honest, engaged comments.
