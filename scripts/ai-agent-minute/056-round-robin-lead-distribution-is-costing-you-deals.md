## Shareable Moment
> "A new agent handed a luxury relocation lead will almost certainly lose it — and the lead will tell everyone they know."

## Why This Rank
Lead routing is an invisible efficiency drain for teams; the wrong-agent-right-lead framing makes the cost concrete.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The wrong agent getting the right lead isn't just inefficient — it's actively damaging your team's reputation with every client that walks away. [ON-SCREEN: Wrong agent + right lead = deal you'll never get back]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Most teams distribute leads by round-robin or whoever answers the phone first. That works fine if every agent is equally suited for every lead type — which they're not. A brand-new agent handed a luxury relocation inquiry will almost certainly lose it, and that client will tell people. An experienced agent assigned to a first-time buyer who needs hand-holding might get impatient and lose them too. Random distribution produces random results. [ON-SCREEN: Round-robin distribution = random results]
And the agents who get mismatched leads don't just lose the deal — they lose confidence. The compounding cost is bigger than the single lost commission.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you build a lead routing matrix. You give it your lead types — price range, buyer versus seller, urgency level, neighborhood, first-time versus experienced client — and your agent profiles: experience level, strengths, current workload, and language capabilities. Claude builds you a simple decision tree your admin runs every time a new lead comes in. The right lead goes to the right agent — every time, not just when someone gets lucky. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Build me a lead routing matrix matching lead types to agent profiles. Here are my lead types and agent profiles: [details]."]
Lead quality matters. Lead-to-agent fit matters just as much. Most teams optimize for the first and ignore the second. You can fix that today.
Does your team have a formal lead routing process right now, or is it still first-come-first-served? Tell me honestly. [ON-SCREEN: Formal lead routing: yes or no?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Highly practical — the "agent loses confidence" agitation point is strong and underused in the original. No overlap with other scripts. No accuracy concerns.
