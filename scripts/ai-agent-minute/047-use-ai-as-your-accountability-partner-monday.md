## On-Screen Title
> Use AI As Your Accountability Partner — Monday Commitments — Friday Check-Ins

## Shareable Moment
> "You don't need a cheerleader. You need something that remembers what you promised and asks you about it. AI does that at zero cost."

## Why This Rank
Accountability is the #1 thing solo agents lack; AI as a non-judgmental accountability partner is a fresh framing.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The number one reason agents don't hit their goals isn't lack of knowledge. It's lack of follow-through. And accountability is the only thing that fixes it. [ON-SCREEN: "It's lack of follow-through — not lack of knowledge"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the accountability gap most agents live in. They either work completely alone with no one checking if they prospected today — or they pay for a coach they go weeks without talking to. In between, there's nothing holding them to the commitments they made to themselves.
And every week that passes without accountability is a week where good intentions stayed intentions. [ON-SCREEN: "Good intentions stayed intentions"]
Here's a system that costs nothing. Every Monday morning, open Claude and type your three commitments for the week — specific, measurable, with a deadline. Then on Friday, come back and tell Claude exactly what you did. Type: "Give me honest, direct feedback on my follow-through this week and help me understand why I dropped the ball on anything I didn't complete." [ON-SCREEN: "Monday commitments → Friday honest review"]
No judgment. No coaching fees. Just clarity.
You don't need a cheerleader. You need something that remembers what you promised and asks you about it. AI does that at zero cost.
What's one commitment you made to yourself this week that you didn't keep? Be honest below. [ON-SCREEN: What commitment did you not keep this week?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Zero cost" is a strong closing note — it undercuts the objection before it forms. The Monday/Friday ritual is immediately actionable and the kind of system people save and screenshot. Strong candidate for a mindset week anchor.
