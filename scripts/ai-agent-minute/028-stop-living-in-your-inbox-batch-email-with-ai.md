## Shareable Moment

## Why This Rank
Email overwhelm is the #1 cited time drain in agent surveys; 'batching' is actionable and specific.

## Full Script (Spoken)

If you checked your email first thing this morning — you've already lost the most valuable hour of your day. [ON-SCREEN: "You've already lost your most valuable hour"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what actually happens. You open your inbox, you start reacting, ninety minutes disappear, it's 10 AM, you haven't prospected, and now the day belongs to everyone else's agenda. Every agent who's ever been distracted by email during prime prospecting hours knows exactly what this costs them.
Email is the enemy of income-producing activity. It's just disguised as productivity. [ON-SCREEN: "Email is the enemy of income. It's disguised as productivity."]
Here's the fix. Batch your email to two windows — ten AM and four PM, nothing in between. Then spend thirty minutes once a week with Claude building your personal response library. Type: "Write twenty of my most common email responses — client updates, offer acknowledgments, vendor coordination, meeting confirmations — in a warm, professional tone that sounds like me." Save them. Customize in thirty seconds. [ON-SCREEN: "Write my 20 most common email responses in my voice"]
Processing your inbox now takes minutes. Not your morning.
Most agents check email first thing every day. The top 10% haven't done that in years — and it shows in their production.
What time do you check email in the morning? Be honest — drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: What time do you check email in the morning?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"If you checked email this morning" is a great hook because it's almost certainly true for every viewer. The "top 10% haven't done that in years" contrast line lands well as a reframe. Pairs naturally with Script #19 as a morning/evening productivity duo.
