## On-Screen Title
> Build Your Commission Defense With AI — Stop Flinching, Start Winning

## Shareable Moment
> "You don't have a commission problem. You have a value communication problem. And that one is completely fixable."

## Why This Rank
Timely post-NAR settlement content that every agent needs and fears; commission compression makes this urgent now.

## Full Script (Spoken)

If you can't explain your commission in sixty seconds without flinching — you're going to lose it. [ON-SCREEN: "If you flinch, you lose it"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what's happening in the market right now. Post-NAR settlement, buyers and sellers are asking harder questions about compensation than they ever have before. Most agents still stumble through something vague about "what's standard" and hope the subject changes.
It won't. And every time you stumble, they hear one thing: even my agent doesn't believe they're worth it. [ON-SCREEN: "Even your agent doesn't believe they're worth it"]
Here's how you fix this. Sit down with Claude and type: "Help me build a clear, confident two-minute value story for why my commission is worth every dollar. My average sale price is [X]. My average days on market is [Y]. My list-to-sale ratio is [Z]. Write it so I can deliver it naturally — not like I'm reading a script." [ON-SCREEN: Paste your numbers → get your value story]
Then practice it out loud until you can say it without thinking. Until it feels like a story you own — not a pitch you borrowed.
You don't have a commission problem. You have a value communication problem. That one is completely fixable — and this is the week to fix it.
When a seller asks why they should pay you — what do you say right now? Drop it in the comments. [ON-SCREEN: What do you say when they ask "why should I pay you?"]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Film in week one — highly time-sensitive given ongoing NAR settlement conversations. The agitation line "even your agent doesn't believe they're worth it" is strong enough to be the on-screen callout. CTA will drive high comment volume.
