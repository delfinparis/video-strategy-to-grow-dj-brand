## Shareable Moment
> "Confidence on cold calls isn't talent. It's reps. AI just made unlimited practice free."

## Why This Rank
Cold call fear is universal; 'unlimited practice free' is a shareable sound bite and the script has no setup friction.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You've memorized your cold call script — so why does it fall apart the second someone pushes back? [ON-SCREEN: "Why does it fall apart the second someone pushes back?"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the problem. Memorizing a script is not the same as practicing one. Real calls go off the rails the moment a prospect says anything unexpected. You freeze. You fumble. You end the call early. No script survives first contact with an actual person.
And here's what most agents never figure out — practicing out loud is the only thing that fixes it. [ON-SCREEN: "Practicing out loud is the only thing that fixes it"]
Here's what works. Open Claude and type: "Act as a skeptical FSBO owner who's had three bad experiences with real estate agents. I'm about to cold call you. Push back hard and stay in character." Then run the call out loud. Ten times. Claude will throw objections you've never heard — so when you pick up the real phone, nothing surprises you. [ON-SCREEN: "Act as a skeptical FSBO — push back hard and stay in character"]
Confidence on cold calls isn't talent. It's reps. AI just made unlimited practice free.

## Producer Note
Top-5 candidate — film in week one. The "unlimited practice free" line will be screenshot and shared. No accuracy issues. Pairs well with Script #9 for a "practice skills" themed week.
