> Audit Your Tech Stack With AI — Cut What You Don't Use — Go Deep On What Works

## Shareable Moment
> "One tool mastered is worth ten tools barely touched. Most agents have it exactly backwards."

## Why This Rank
Tech audit is financially valuable but less emotionally urgent than other money scripts; pairs well in a 'business cleanup' week.

## Full Script (Spoken)

The average real estate agent is paying for five tools they barely use — and missing the one workflow that would actually change their business. [ON-SCREEN: "Paying for five tools they barely use"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happened to most of us. Tech in real estate exploded. CRM, transaction management, social scheduling, email marketing, lead gen platforms, video tools — you signed up for a few of them, used each one for two weeks, and forgot about them. Now you're spending hundreds of dollars a month on software that isn't moving the needle.
And the worst part? The overwhelm of having too many tools often stops agents from going deep on any of them. [ON-SCREEN: "Too many tools stops you from going deep on any of them"]
Here's the fix. List every tool you're currently subscribed to and how often you actually use each one. Give that list to Claude and type: "For a solo real estate agent doing [X] deals per year, which of these tools overlap, which should I cut immediately, and what's the one missing capability that would have the highest ROI?" [ON-SCREEN: "Which should I cut — and what am I missing?"]
Then actually cancel what it tells you to cut. And go all in on what stays.
One tool mastered is worth ten tools barely touched. Most agents have it exactly backwards.
How many software tools are you currently paying for? Drop the number — no judgment. [ON-SCREEN: How many tools are you paying for right now?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"No judgment" in the CTA is a smart addition — lowers the barrier to commenting. The "overwhelm stops you from going deep" agitation line is the best addition here. No accuracy issues.
