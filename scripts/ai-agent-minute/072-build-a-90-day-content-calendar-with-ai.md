# Build A 90-Day Content Calendar With AI

## On-Screen Title
> Build A 90-Day Content Calendar With AI — Stop Posting Randomly

## Shareable Moment
> "Content that compounds is content that was planned. Spontaneous posts generate spontaneous results — which is to say, almost none."

## Why This Rank
Content planning prevents the blank-screen paralysis that kills marketing consistency; calendar in one session is strong.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Posting whenever you feel like it isn't a content strategy. It's just noise with occasional bursts of effort. [ON-SCREEN: "Noise with occasional bursts of effort"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why random posting never builds an audience. There's no theme, no progression, no reason for anyone to follow along for what comes next. The algorithm doesn't reward randomness. And potential clients don't either — because they can't figure out what you stand for.
Most agents post when inspired. The top producers post on a plan — and that plan is what builds an audience that actually converts. [ON-SCREEN: "The plan is what builds an audience that converts"]
Here's how to build the plan. Sit down with Claude and type: "Help me build a ninety-day content calendar. My five content pillars are [list them]. I post [X] times a week. My two main goals are [leads/recruiting/both]. Generate a week-by-week plan with content type, topic, hook, and CTA for each post." [ON-SCREEN: "90-day calendar — topic, hook, and CTA for every post"]
Print it. Put it on your wall. Execute it. Come back in ninety days and see what actually worked.
Content that compounds is content that was planned. Spontaneous posts generate spontaneous results — which is to say, almost none.
Do you have a content calendar right now — or are you figuring it out day by day? Tell me below. [ON-SCREEN: Content calendar — or figuring it out daily?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Mild overlap with Script #17 (content batching) — keep this focused on the strategic planning angle, Script #17 on the batching mechanic. Don't film these in the same week. "Print it, put it on your wall" is a genuinely actionable close.
