# Use AI To Build The Business You Actually Want

**Category:** All Categories — Capstone | **Avatar:** All | **AI Tool:** Claude

## On-Screen Title
> The Business You're Building — Is It Actually the One You Want?

## Shareable Moment
> "Most agents spend so much time working in their business that they never stop to ask if it's the one they actually wanted — and one day they realize they built something they never consciously chose."

## Why This Rank
The most emotionally resonant script in the series; hold as the series milestone post (episode 50 or series anniversary) for maximum impact.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You got into real estate for a reason. Is the business you've built actually delivering it — or did you just get busy and stop asking? [ON-SCREEN: You got into real estate for a reason. Is it delivering?]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happens to most agents. The years go by. Production fluctuates. The hustle becomes habit. And somewhere in there, the original reason you got into this — the freedom, the income, the control, whatever it was — either arrived quietly without being noticed, or drifted away without being mourned. Most agents have never stopped to ask: is this business actually giving me the life I wanted when I started? And then one day they realize they've been building something they never consciously chose. [ON-SCREEN: Still building the same business out of momentum — not intention?]
That's not a business problem. That's a direction problem. And it's the most important one to solve.
Here's the most valuable thing I can suggest you do with AI. Once a year — January works well — sit down with Claude for a two-hour business vision session. Answer the questions most agents never make time for: What does my ideal business look like in five years — specifically, not vaguely? What does an ideal work week look like, hour by hour? What clients do I genuinely love serving? What would I eliminate tomorrow if I could? And most importantly — what did I originally want this business to give me, and is it currently doing that? Ask Claude to turn your honest answers into a one-page business design document. Review it every quarter. Build toward it every week. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Here are my honest answers to 5 questions about what I want my business to give me. Turn this into a one-page business design document."]
AI can make you more productive. But the real gift — the one most agents never use — is using it to get more intentional. So the business you're building is actually the one you want.
What does your ideal real estate business look like — really? Not the polished version. The real one. Tell me below. I read every single comment. [ON-SCREEN: What does your ideal business actually look like?]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
The capstone — this is the highest-scoring script in the batch and should be treated as a milestone post (episode 100, series anniversary, or New Year launch). D.J. should deliver this one with more personal warmth and slightly slower pace than other scripts. The CTA will generate the longest comment thread in the series. Film this as a special — slightly different setting or framing if possible.
