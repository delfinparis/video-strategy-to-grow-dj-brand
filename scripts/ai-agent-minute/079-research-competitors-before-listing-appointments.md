## On-Screen Title
> Research Competitors Before Listing Appointments — Win With Strategy

## Shareable Moment
> "Listing appointments are competitive. The agents who win consistently treat them that way. The ones who don't show up with a folder and a prayer."

## Why This Rank
Competitive intelligence prep is smart; less urgency than #8 (listing prep) but a good companion piece.

## Full Script (Spoken)

You're walking into listing appointments without knowing who else is being interviewed — and that's like playing poker without looking at your own cards. [ON-SCREEN: "Like playing poker without looking at your cards"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the reality. Sellers typically interview two or three agents. The ones who consistently win know who they're competing against — their recent production in the neighborhood, how they present themselves online, their reviews, their weaknesses. Most agents never look any of this up.
So they show up with a folder and hope. The top producers show up with a strategy. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents show up with a folder. Top producers show up with a strategy."]
Here's how to build the strategy. Use Perplexity to research your likely competition — their recent sales in the neighborhood, their online positioning, their Google reviews, their average days on market. Then take that into Claude and type: "Given how this competitor positions themselves, give me three specific ways I can differentiate in my listing presentation without ever mentioning them by name." [ON-SCREEN: "3 ways to differentiate without mentioning them by name"]
You walk in knowing things they don't know you know.
Do you research your competition before a listing appointment? Yes or no — drop it in the comments. [ON-SCREEN: Do you research competitors before listing appointments?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The contrast line "folder and hope vs. strategy" is the sharpest addition — consider making it the on-screen callout. Two-tool workflow (Perplexity + Claude) needs a beat that makes it feel simple, not complicated.
