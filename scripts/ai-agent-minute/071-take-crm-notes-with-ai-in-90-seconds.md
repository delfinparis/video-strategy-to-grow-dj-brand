## Why This Rank
CRM discipline is the infrastructure that makes all other systems work; 90-second promise is specific and believable.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your CRM is only as good as the notes you actually put in it — and most agents put in almost nothing. [ON-SCREEN: "Most agents put in almost nothing"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's how it actually plays out. After every call or showing, you tell yourself you'll update the CRM later. Later never comes. Six months go by and your database is full of half-completed records with no context. When you finally reach back out to someone, you have no idea what you talked about, what they were looking for, or why they went cold.
You're starting from zero every time — with a lead you already paid for. [ON-SCREEN: "Starting from zero with a lead you already paid for"]
Here's the fix — and it takes ninety seconds. Right after any call or showing, open your voice-to-text app and talk for sixty seconds: what the person said, what they care about, where they are in the process. Then paste that voice memo into Claude and type: "Reformat this into clean CRM notes with a summary, next action, and follow-up date." [ON-SCREEN: "Reformat this into CRM notes with summary, next action, and follow-up date"]
Paste the result into your CRM. Done.
Your database is your retirement account. Treat every note like a deposit.
How up-to-date are your CRM notes right now? Scale of one to ten — drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: Rate your CRM notes 1–10]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
The "retirement account" metaphor is the most memorable line — make it the visual callout. The voice-memo workflow is genuinely novel and immediately actionable. No accuracy issues. Film early in the series.
