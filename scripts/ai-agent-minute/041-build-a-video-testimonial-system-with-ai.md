## On-Screen Title
> Build A Video Testimonial System With AI — Not Hope Clients Film One — Create Content That Sells For You

## Shareable Moment
> "A sixty-second video from a happy client sells your services better than anything you could ever say about yourself. Most agents never collect one."

## Why This Rank
Video testimonials are the most credible lead conversion tool; few agents have a process for collecting them.

## Full Script (Spoken)

A sixty-second video from a happy client sells your services better than anything you could ever say about yourself. And most agents never collect a single one. [ON-SCREEN: "Better than anything you could say yourself"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's why agents don't collect video testimonials even from clients who would happily give them one. The ask feels awkward. The client doesn't know what to say. The filming feels technical and complicated. So the moment passes. The deal closes. The opportunity disappears. And the agent has exactly the same thin review profile they had before.
Most agents have happy clients and no video proof. The ones who do have it built a system. [ON-SCREEN: "Happy clients + no video proof = missing a system"]
Here's the system. Ask Claude to build a frictionless video testimonial request. Type: "Write a post-closing message asking a client for a sixty-second phone video testimonial. Include: three specific questions to prompt what they should say — 'What were you most worried about before we started?' 'What surprised you most?' 'Who would you recommend me to?' — simple phone filming instructions, and a genuine thank-you. Make the ask feel natural, not like a form." [ON-SCREEN: "3 questions + simple filming instructions + natural ask"]
Giving clients a script isn't cheesy — most people genuinely don't know what to say, and having a guide is actually a relief.

See you next time.

## Producer Note
"Giving them a script isn't cheesy" is the objection-handling moment that will make agents feel permission to do this — important line, keep it. The three specific questions are genuinely good and worth making on-screen callouts.
