## On-Screen Title
> Build A Relocation Welcome Packet With AI — Not Wing It — Win The Most Valuable Clients In Real Estate

## Shareable Moment
> "Relocation buyers choose agents who make an unfamiliar city feel familiar. AI helps you build that confidence before you ever meet them."

## Why This Rank
Relocation clients are high-value and loyal; a welcome packet positions the agent as a community guide, not just a transaction processor.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Relocation buyers are among the most valuable clients in real estate — and most local agents are completely unprepared for them. [ON-SCREEN: "Most local agents are completely unprepared"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what relocation buyers actually need. They're moving to a city they don't know. They need more information, more trust-building, and more hand-holding than any local buyer. What do most agents do? Send them a Zillow search link and schedule a showing tour. The buyer arrives, feels overwhelmed, and realizes the agent knows nothing about the city they're trying to help them understand.
Most agents show relocation buyers houses. Top producers show them the city. [ON-SCREEN: "Show them the city — not just the houses"]
Here's the tool that wins this client before you ever meet them. Use Claude and Perplexity to build a Relocation Welcome Packet. Type: "Build a comprehensive guide for a buyer relocating to [your city]. Include: neighborhood profiles for five areas with different vibes and price points, commute time analysis to the top three major employers, school comparison data, a 'new to the city' amenities guide, and a step-by-step buying process timeline for out-of-town buyers." Format it cleanly. Email it the day they reach out. [ON-SCREEN: "Neighborhood profiles + commute data + school info + buying timeline"]
They will call every other agent and send it to that one.

Have you worked with relocation buyers? Tell me the first thing they always ask you. [ON-SCREEN: What do relocation buyers always ask first?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
"They will call every other agent and send it to that one" — keep this line, it's the most memorable close in the script. Runs slightly long — trim the Zillow search description on delivery.
