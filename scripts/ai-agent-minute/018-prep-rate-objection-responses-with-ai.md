## On-Screen Title
> Prep Rate Objection Responses With AI — Keep Nervous Clients From Walking

## Shareable Moment
> "Your job isn't to predict interest rates. It's to help clients make confident decisions with real information. Those are completely different jobs — and only one of them is yours."

## Why This Rank
Rate anxiety is the current market's dominant buyer blocker; agents who can handle this objection confidently close more deals right now.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Your client just texted you: "Rates went up again. We're thinking of waiting." What do you say in the next sixty seconds? [ON-SCREEN: "What do you say in the next 60 seconds?"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what most agents do. They either panic alongside the client, give a vague "rates always come down eventually" answer, or launch into something that sounds like they Googled it that morning. None of those build confidence. And a client who loses confidence doesn't pause — they disappear for months.
Most agents try to predict the market. Top producers help clients decide despite it. [ON-SCREEN: "Help clients decide despite the market — not predict it"]
Here's the fix. Once a month, pull current rate data from Perplexity, bring it into Claude, and type: "Prepare response frameworks for these three conversations: 'Should we wait for rates to drop?' 'Rates are too high to buy right now.' 'We're going to rent instead.' Each framework needs a simple math example, one local market data point, and a closing line that leaves the client feeling informed — not pressured." [ON-SCREEN: "3 frameworks — math example, local data, confident close"]
Practice those frameworks until they're automatic. Your job isn't to predict rates. It's to help clients make confident decisions with real information.
What's the rate question you hear most from clients right now? Drop it below — I'll address it in an upcoming video. [ON-SCREEN: What rate question do you hear most?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Time-sensitive — rate anxiety is a live issue in this market. Film soon. The opening scenario ("your client just texted") is a strong mirror moment because it's specific and present-tense. The CTA will generate a useful ongoing content bank of rate questions to address.
