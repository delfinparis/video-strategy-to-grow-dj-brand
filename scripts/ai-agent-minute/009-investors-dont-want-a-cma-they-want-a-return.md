## Shareable Moment
> "Investors don't hire agents — they hire analysts who happen to have a real estate license."

## Why This Rank
The hook 'Investors hire analysts, not agents' is the sharpest single line in the batch; high save and share potential.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Investors don't hire agents. They hire analysts who happen to have a real estate license — and most agents don't know the difference until they lose the client. [ON-SCREEN: Investors hire analysts — not agents.]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's the scene. An investor asks you to evaluate a rental property. You pull a CMA, show them what comparable homes sold for, and send it over. They never call back. Why? Because they didn't want to know what it's worth. They wanted to know what it returns. Cap rate. Cash-on-cash return. Gross rent estimate. Vacancy allowance. Net operating income. If you can't give them that analysis, they'll find an agent who can — and that agent will have them for life. [ON-SCREEN: They didn't want a CMA. They wanted a return analysis.]
And here's what it costs you — investors buy repeatedly. Lose one client and you've lost a decade of transactions.
Here's the fix. Ask Claude to build you a reusable investment property analysis template that calculates: projected gross rent, vacancy allowance, operating expenses, net operating income, cap rate, and estimated cash-on-cash return. Then use Perplexity to pull current rental comps for any specific property in your market — takes four minutes. Attach this analysis to every investment property presentation. You become the first agent investor clients call — not because you're luckier, but because you're the only one who shows up with the numbers. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt → "Build me an investment property analysis template calculating gross rent, vacancy, NOI, cap rate, and cash-on-cash return."]
In twelve years interviewing top producers, the ones who built investor books of business all had one thing in common — they could speak in numbers. AI helps you get there without a finance degree.
Do you currently provide investment return analysis to your investor clients? Yes, no, or sometimes — tell me honestly. [ON-SCREEN: Do you provide return analysis? Yes / No / Sometimes]
"See you next time."

## Producer Note
Top-10 film-first candidate. The hook is one of the strongest in the entire batch. Note intentional overlap with Script #86 on investor theme — space them at least two weeks apart. No accuracy concerns.
