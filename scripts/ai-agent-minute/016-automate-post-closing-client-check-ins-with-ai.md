## On-Screen Title
> Automate Post-Closing Client Check-Ins With AI — Never Lose A Referral

## Shareable Moment
> "70% of buyers say they'd use their agent again. Only 11% actually do. That gap has a name — forgetting to stay in touch."

## Why This Rank
Post-closing follow-up is the #1 missed referral touchpoint; the 'twelve-month calendar in twenty minutes' promise is a strong save trigger.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Seventy percent of buyers say they'd use their agent again. Only eleven percent actually do. That gap has a name — and it's not disloyalty. [ON-SCREEN: "70% would use you again. 11% actually do."]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's what happens after most closings. You send a thank-you note, maybe a closing gift, and then you disappear. The client loved working with you — but six months later, when their neighbor asks for a realtor recommendation, they can't quite remember your last name. Not because you did bad work. Because you vanished.
Most agents lose their best clients not to a competitor — but to their own silence. [ON-SCREEN: "Lost to their own silence"]
Here's the fix. Use Claude to build a twelve-month post-closing check-in sequence for every client. Type: "Write twelve monthly check-in messages for a past real estate client: month one is a personalized move-in note, month three is a home value update, month six is a seasonal maintenance checklist, month twelve is a one-year anniversary message with a market update. Write all twelve in a warm, personal tone that sounds like me." [ON-SCREEN: "Write 12 monthly check-ins — personalized, warm, in my voice"]
Load them into your CRM. Set them to send automatically. Your clients feel remembered without you lifting a finger.
Your past clients are your most valuable asset. AI makes sure you never lose one to neglect again.
When's the last time you reached out to a past client just to check in — not to sell anything? Drop it below. [ON-SCREEN: When did you last check in with a past client just because?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Verify the 70%/11% stat before filming — it's widely cited in real estate circles but source should be confirmed (NAR data). This is a top-10 candidate; the stat alone will stop the scroll. "Lost to their own silence" is the most shareable line in this script.
