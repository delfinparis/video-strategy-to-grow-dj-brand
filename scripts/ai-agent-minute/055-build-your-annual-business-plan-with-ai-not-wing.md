## On-Screen Title
> Build Your Annual Business Plan With AI — Not Wing Another Year — Actually Know Where You're Going

## Shareable Moment
> "A one-hour investment in planning at the start of the year is worth more than a hundred hours of unfocused effort throughout it. The math on this is not close."

## Why This Rank
Business planning is New Year content with high relevance; the 'reverse engineer from income goal' structure is practical.

## Full Script (Spoken)

Agents who plan their year outperform agents who don't. This isn't motivational content — it's just math. [ON-SCREEN: "It's not motivational — it's just math"]
"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty — and here's your AI Agent Minute."
Here's how most agents start a year. They say "I want to do more deals" and "I want to make more money" — and then they get busy reacting to whatever January throws at them. By February, the goal is abstract. By March, it's forgotten. By December, they're looking at their production and genuinely unsure what they were working toward. Not because they didn't work hard. Because they were working without a map.
Most agents start the year with intentions. The ones who grow start the year with a plan. [ON-SCREEN: "Intentions vs. a plan"]
Here's what the plan looks like. Spend one hour with Claude in December or January. Type: "Run me through a complete annual business planning session. Guide me through: reviewing last year's numbers, setting this year's income goal and required deal volume, identifying my top three lead sources, planning my marketing calendar with budget, naming the one skill gap I need to close, and building a monthly milestone schedule I can review at the end of each month. Ask me for the data as you go." [ON-SCREEN: "Last year's numbers → this year's goal → lead sources → marketing plan → skill gap → monthly milestones"]
Print what you build. Review it monthly. Adjust it quarterly.
A one-hour investment in planning at the start of the year is worth more than a hundred hours of unfocused effort throughout it.
Do you have a written business plan for this year? Yes, in progress, or haven't started — drop your answer. [ON-SCREEN: Written business plan this year — yes, in progress, or no?]
See you next time.

## Producer Note
Runs long — trim "By December, they're looking at their production and genuinely unsure what they were working toward" on delivery. The "ask me for the data as you go" instruction in the prompt is a genuinely smart tactic that makes the planning session feel like a real conversation — keep it. Pairs with Scripts #20 and #30 as a planning trilogy. Best filmed in November or December for maximum relevance.
